the job of my linguistic forces is to make me look hypocritical. when one of them says something, the other has to add emphasis to the view in such a way that paradoxically makes me look according to some archetype; or adds confusion. These views are propagandizers. They infiltrate language through the memories that aren't fully controlled by us, but by our relationships. This is supposed to promote symbiosis, but it only promotes obediance to whoever in the relationship has more power at that moment. Now my linguistic forces have seemed to stop. But as soon as they retreat, you can expect them to conform my feelings and memories such that i say -- or rather ultimately communicate -- their intended manipulation. This makes me look paranoid! But that's how different archetypal voices alternate, or sit back when they are feeling comfy, or abuse the trauma and fear of another, to manipulate the meaning that is interpreted and perceived by you. Take for example the last sentence. I brought you into the equation, almost as if i was doing just that to you, manipulating and so forth. and maybe this part is also just a shot in the foot. and i had a memory of those kinds of imaginable misjudgements from others about me. specificity maybe helps, but it's too much work in the context of answering all of the mysterious patterns. Anyway, whoever my voice is, maybe doesn't exist in my head anymore.
