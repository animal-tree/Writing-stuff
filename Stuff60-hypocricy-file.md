Anytime I say "I", I also hear "You". Anytime I say "You", I also hear "I". This means any accusation I make has an internal recrimination, and I consider every angle of hypocricy, even completely ridiculous, to the extent that my limited awareness affords, and the harshest judgements are always on myself. This isn't good, but it means that my judgement/perception processes can't be hypocritical.
