How can nothing bring rise to something, mathematically? We think we have solved the confounding "cosmogenesis" riddle with the use of 3-way mathematical implications in the definition of definition. Correct us if we're wrong.

First, let us define a symbol for our "nothing". $\emptyset$. Very good, now:

---

**Axiom 1:** $\exists \emptyset, \mathrm{I}$.

---

The empty set, "nothing" and the Identity function, exist. This may or may not be debatable, whether it should be an axiom or a theorem, since by definition:

$\mathrm{I}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$

is not self-contradicting. Can a function "exist"?

To that end, we will argue yes, by noting the function of observation. "I observe." Whatever this function is, perhaps we can equate it to $\mathrm{I}$ the Identity function. By analogy, if not, in a moment... literally.

For that matter, an elementary particle, something that is *presumed*, axiomatically, to exist without justifying cause, hence "elementary", is itself a function with a quantum state that affects and determines the functions of other elementary particles. Perhaps... in a moment... we will equate it to $\mathrm{I}$ as well.

This would be mathematically impressive if we did so without further assumptions, using only the rules of mathematical deduction!

Hopefully, if that motivates the exploration, let's proceed. i.e. 3 goals:

(1) a logically consistent "cosmogenesis".
(2) observation, and its substituents, Qualia.
(3) elementary particles.

From just the established axiom: $\exists \emptyset, \mathrm{I}$. Using only the fair-game rules of mathematical deduction.

We may need some more axioms along the way, but for now, let's see how far we can get with just what we have.

---

**Definition 1:** Observation. 

Let $o = \mathrm{I}$ be observation. Every variable equivalent:

$\mathrm{I_1} = \mathrm{I_2} = \cdots = o$

Furthermore, $o = \mathrm{I}_I, \forall I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

These are just variables to describe the same constant.

---

Since $\exists \mathrm{I}$, we can now play around with $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}) = \mathrm{I}$ and variations of it using Qualia $\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) = \mathrm{I_j}$.

For instance, we have:

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) = \mathrm{I_j} = \mathrm{I_k} = \mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_k})$,

suggesting a simple equivalence with no secret-catch. Let's however unfold this:

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{I_j} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{I_k} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_k})$

From here, through the use of cycles, we will see how "something" can arise from nothing. In fact, this is at the basis of all math. Every deduction is premised on *defined* axioms and implications. The theorems derived from them all reduce to "by definition" and yet many branching paths and interpretations, useful ones to the real world, emerge from exploring nothing more, mathematically speaking, than definition. "What is definition?", philosophically speaking. Perhaps it is something that arises from the real world, the existence of many within equivalence.

One way to satisfy the earlier defined equivalence is:

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) \rightarrow \mathrm{I_j} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_k} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_k})$

and

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) \leftarrow \mathrm{I_j} \leftarrow \mathrm{I_k} \leftarrow \mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_k})$

and perhaps multi-node arrows going in-between to create a fully-connected graph. But minimally, a simple cycle would suffice:

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) \rightarrow \mathrm{I_j} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_k} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_k})$

and

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) \leftarrow \mathrm{I_j} \leftarrow \mathrm{I_k} \leftarrow \mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_k})$.

The cycle justifies all of the other arrows and satisfies the definition of equivalence. Extra implications, while theoretically optional, are not needed. We could from here, create causality. 

Under the ambiguities that remain, $\mathrm{I}$ can be defined different behaviors in addition to the ones already defined. In fact they must be, for mathematical soundness. For example:

does $\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) \rightarrow \mathrm{I_i}$?

The answer is yes, but not *before* 

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) \rightarrow \mathrm{I_j} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_i}$.

Unless the identity graph were fully-connected. But, under the mathematical ambiguity, let us define equivalence here:

---

**Definition 2:** Disambiguated Qualia uniqueness.

$\mathrm{I_i}$ are not substitutable in the domain of the function that defines their equivalence.

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) \not\rightarrow_1 \mathrm{I_i}$.

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j})$ does *not* imply $\mathrm{I_i}$ in one deductive step,

where $\rightarrow_n$ denotes the number of deductive steps $n \in \mathbb{N}$. 

---

**Definition 3:** Qualia and qualia.

$\mathbb{Q} = \mathrm{I}_I \vert I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is Qualia, where any $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ will be referred to as qualia, lowercase.

These are just variables to describe the same constant.

qualia are the "distinguishing traits".

$\mathbb{N}$ are not strictly the natural numbers and may not be infinite.

---

In other words, qualia are distinguishable in the domain of observers in Qualia.

Notice there is no contradiction to this in the definition of equivalence or Qualia/qualia or the function of $o = \mathrm{I}$.

---

**Theorem 1:** Furthermore, $\exists \mathbb{Q}$.

**Proof:** By Axiom 1 and Definition 1, $\exists o$. 

$o = \mathrm{I}_I, \forall I \in \mathbb{N}, I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

Then $\exists \mathrm{I}_I, \forall I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

By Axiom 1 (using the empty set), $\exists \mathbb{Q}$. $\square$

---

"Does a set "exist"?" That's another question we can ask. Mathematically, it is a convenient organizing tool for describing many subparts at once. Each of the subparts exists by equivalence to $I$, therefore $\exists \mathbb{Q}$, by which we mean: the subparts exist.

Qualia, interestingly, is proof that something can emerge from almost-nothing.
