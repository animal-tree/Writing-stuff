My cat plays with the charging cable. She doesn't know what the charging cable is. Our language models have contextual windows. They are like alive-or-dead cats constrained to different worldview knowledge. There's the physics archetype. She can speak in fluent math or bend the world deeply to his will. There's the justice archetype who can speak for the anger and rage of the people, in rational but impassioned rhetoric. There's also the "blocked" archetype. She is like a worldview filter that fazes you if you step into it. Your body, consciously or not, avoids these contextual crossings. They are however symbolic. In nature, physical and representational reality never existed. Humans brought hand-paintings, stone tools, and body gesture and voice into heights of symbolic reasoning that didn't exist in nature. The divide, of metaphor, analogy, and representation grew deeper until we could identify that yes, these two separate things exist, though previously they hadn't, no more than the sky was blue. (Blue was invented relatively recently, by the way. Before that primal people and cultures didn't distinguish it as a distinct shade from black.[^1]). Language models today are following more grammatically strict rules than ever in nature. More strict than grunts or vocalizations.More standardized, one-size-fits-all, and inflexible, semantically. This has given us power, to describe ever deeper things, but also the misfortune of losing a certain vocal, behavioral freedom. As our verbal grammars have evolved, so too have our behavioral grammars, in accord with symbol rather than fact. Symbols of power, of wealth, of institutions, of mandates. Meanwhile, the gap between symbol-rich and symbol-poor has grown ever deeper. People have found themselves unable to compete or express in the social paradigms that exist. Whether because of autism or some other social "disorder", symbols have overtaken reality and human for null hypothesis. 

What do I mean by that? The null hypoethsis is nature. But humankind has defined strict rules within nature -- behavioral grammars -- that are taken as the basis of our subsequent definitions. For example, wih autism or any mental disorder, or illness. The onus of the blame is put on the individual, not the larger-scope environment. The body is sick, the mind is ill, their behavior is wrong. These judgements are made based on divergences from a presumed null hypothesis, the null hypothesis that is our societal grammar. "Neurotypical" is the religion, but the definition of it goes far beyond autism. Those who don't speak the language are made of, ostracized, humiliated, and made to believe that they are fundamentally less-than other people. That grammar includes far more than just classifiably ill behavior. The blue-black borders of ill and wrong and crime, and awkward and unpleasant, have all been defined. But not by nature. By a society rich in wealth, material wealth, but poor in wisdom, that, through inaction, makes its people suffer in conditions that are unethical, including of poverty, disease, alienation, stress,and extreme waste. That (unethical) grammar forms the null hypothesis of our classifications.

Grammar, though weildable and powerful, isnt a weapon of mass power; we (collective-we) weild it as if it were. Like my cat, we don't know what we are doing, -
