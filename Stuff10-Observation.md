One thing physicists assume is the existence of an observable universe.

However, there is no such thing besides observation. Observation includes memories, percepts, feelings, thoughts, and so on.

Memories include memories of dynamics, teachings from others, decisions that led to pain, decisions that led to pleasure, and more.

We also observe, or unconsciously exercise, our own trust in those memories and observations.

One limitation of this is that it assumes a physics outside our minds. This is deductively impossible, without establishing as an axiom. Un-axiomatically, all we can say about the universe and deduce from there is: I observe.

"I observe, therefore I am."

"I observe this memory and this pain, and therefore I believe in this knowledge and this decision."

Deriving physics from this point of view is challenging, but not impossible. Unlike to other point of views, it doesn't risk conflating belief with fact. Relativity hints at this, but is defined under an axiomatic paradigm rather than a belief-based one. Under a belief-based one, we can obtain the facts of relativity without making the same assumptions about the absolute universe. Same result, different, more intuitive interpretation.

For example, the time dilation of moving bodies relative to one another is attributed to the strange relative mechanics of the universe. From a belief-perspective, it can be interpretted as a communication delay, between body 1 and body 2, mediated by a limitted-speed carrier signal, the photon. The photon need not be the communication proxy in this understanding and can therefore be substituted with an electron or galaxy or any measuring tool. Its carrier signal, whatever it is, mathemtically becomes the "fastest speed in the universe", allowing us to re-interpret Einstein's result about the universe's max speed limit as a mathematical byproduct due to the choice of carrier signal as the photon.
