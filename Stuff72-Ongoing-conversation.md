The requirement for reviews is documented in the CS PhD Student Handbook.  Deadlines for reviews are communicated to all PhD students and advisors via email every year.

Hi Michael,

I was excused from the one I missed in Fall, 2022, as detailed below (due to Henry's absence), and remediated it in Spring, 2023. The one in Spring, 2023, I passed, under the condition that I provide the committee with a one-page chapter-list (or at least that was what was said during the meeting). I will remind you that this was a brand new committee and that one of the committee members didn't remember that meeting. Chris Kanan's pretty extraordinary memory lapse, as you'll recall, is documented on email. 30-minute Zoom meeting that the four of us had as being 1.5 hours and not once, but twice! My goodness. It was scheduled for 30 minutes, as the other committee members can hopefully recall: 20 minutes reserved for my presentation and the last 10 minutes for their independent-room discussion and final remarks. After that six-month review, and the independent-room discussion that followed and after they laid out what I had to do next (a one-page chapter-list), I was informed of the following requirements not originally decided by the committee:

(1) before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters, </br>
(2) before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.

I sent them the chapter-list as well as a 6-page write-up containing the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches (and made sure to cleanly summarize those parts on approximately a single page in that write-up), as documented on email also. In total, I sent a 6-page write-up instead of a 1-page write-up as well as the originally required chapter-list.

A six-month review, to remind you, is an informal meeting meant to help the student. The grad school, not me, should be accountable for committee members and an advisor, and then a second advisor, leaving (especially with short, no, or again short notice).

My question is, since I felt your answer was disingenuous: whether the second requirement ("before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.") was mentioned at any point at/between the time of termination and October 31st, by anyone other than me (since I conveniently mentioned it for you in my grad department email of October 30th).

Regarding Henry's absence, Chenliang was aware from Fall semester into Spring semester that I had missed that six-month review, most likely understanding that: (1) six-month reviews are informal assessments meant to help the student, not live-or-die assessments on which termination can be suspiciously, ambiguously, and retroactively justified, and (2) Henry couldn't attend, which I was not notified of until last-minute (Chenliang, not Henry, notified me, last-minute just at that six-month review time point, that my former advisor and active committee member was retiring and wouldn't be available). After I was excused (by my advisor, and as far as I could know department), I was not notified again until the Spring one with a new committee, since one other committee member had left. 

Now, to remind you, I also suffered many induced and excruciatingly severe tragedies while I was employed and working as a student that the university did not yet address. 

However, for now, it would mean a lot to me if you could answer my question [yes/no, specify when, and provide a quotation as proof].

This was the question:

> Was this six-month review mentioned at/between the time of my termination and October 31st?

Since you bring up the PhD student handbook, here is a direct quote: "When withdrawing support, the faculty will indicate to the student, in writing, what is necessary for reinstatement of support." (Page 15). 

You wrote: "If I do not hear from you by 6 Oct., with a plan for successful completion, the department will terminate your stipend and discontinue your enrollment as of 31 Oct. 2023." 

I complied by detailing a reasonable plan for successful completion. 

You replied: "I have conferred with members of your committee. They confirm that the plan you outline is neither consistent with what you originally proposed for the PhD nor a viable path to completion of the degree. With regret, we will be terminating your student status and stipend as of the end of October." 

The six-month review was not given as a reason for termination, nor a "what is necessary for reinstatement of support." Rather, this earlier reason for termination was modified multiple times as you sought a more valid one, which I conveniently provided for you in my grad department email on October 30th. On October 31st, the last formal day of my employment, you assumed that reason (the six-month review) and did not "indicate to the student, in writing, what is necessary for reinstatement of support." I proved over our exchanges, and you seemed to realize it, that my plan was "consistent with what I originally proposed for the PhD" and "a viable path to completion of the degree," with more evidence on those fronts than you probably remember.

A later  reason you gave: "By all indications, you have been unwilling to heed the counsel of your advisor and committee — the people you yourself chose to advise you and to judge the quality of your work." Also disproven via the 6-page write-up and chapter-list and the systems work I implemented on their advice and reported to Chenliang in person (sampling without replacement replay memory, if he recalls). And the fact that we only met once, so your "indications" are impossible.

What exactly did you want me to do? Conjure a thesis in ~3 months and do a six-month review in that time or find a **third** advisor in my **6th year** (and work on no funding), having given 10 years of my life here? 3 of those years under Chenliang, in which I published 2 papers. 2 papers in 3 years, including one in a top venue, is a pretty reasonable publication rate. Here is what I bet: however you try to justify the "what is necessary for reinstatement of support", you will provide only gaslighting (if anything): vague wisdoms like "meeting all milestones" or "if you would heed their advice regarding the research plan" without any specifics. Before recommending how a PhD student who is smarter than you finishes his PhD, maybe have specifics.

Since you bring up deadlines, I just want to add that I was notified of my stipend being cut prior to the six-month review deadline, as Chenliang, the entire committee, and you yourself can confirm.
