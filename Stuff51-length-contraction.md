Assume time dilation:

$$t' = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

$v' = \frac{vt'}{t}$ and $x' = v't'$ from reference frame $K'$ perspective. We thus have

$\rightarrow x' = \frac{vt'^2}{t} = \frac{v(\frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}})^2}{t} = \frac{vt}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

derived length contraction.

Noting that reference frame $K'$ perceives itself to be traveling at velocity $0$, but its measuring units since accelerating to that speed have changed.

### Description

Meanwhile a measuring rod remains the same in physical space (no length contraction), it just no longer corresponds to the previous time unit of motion. That is, moving at $v'=1$ will cover a different distance in $\Delta t'=1$ than measured by that measuring rod. Thus, we need to mark a new measuring unit length â€”  but only formally due to the dilated passage of time making that original distance cost a different amount of physical energy to traverse. Our muscles would have to strain to a different degree and perhaps take more or less time to walk across the spaceship for example, but the spaceship's size would not be perceived bigger or smaller, nor would it actually contract or expand. Merely, both distance and velocity are an adaptation of measuring unit formalities to keep proportional with the newly-dilated (and literally/perceptually-dilated) time progression.
