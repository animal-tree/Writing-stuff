Assume time dilation:

$$t' = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

$v' = \frac{vt'}{t}$ and $x' = v't'$ from reference frame $K'$ perspective. We thus have

$\rightarrow x' = \frac{vt'^2}{t} = \frac{v(\frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}})^2}{t} = \frac{vt}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

derived length contraction.

Noting that reference frame $K'$ perceives itself to be traveling at velocity $0$, but its measuring units since accelerating to that speed have changed.

### Description

Meanwhile a measuring rod remains the same in physical space (no length contraction), it just no longer corresponds to the previous time unit of motion. That is, moving at $v'=1$ will cover a different distance in $\Delta t'=1$ than measured by that measuring rod. Thus, we need to mark a new measuring unit length â€”  but only formally due to the dilated passage of time making that original distance cost a different amount of physical energy to traverse. Our muscles would have to strain to a different degree and perhaps take more or less time to walk across the spaceship for example, but the spaceship's size would not be perceived bigger or smaller, nor would it actually contract or expand. Merely, both distance and velocity are an adaptation of measuring unit formalities to keep proportional with the newly-dilated (and literally/perceptually-dilated) time progression.

### Speculative explanation for time dilation

The perception of time dilation is perhaps possible due to a linear-angular velocity tradeoff of orbiting/bouncing sub-elementary particles all regularized to the same absolute speed constant $c$, that would be measured bi-directionally as $c$ from any reference frame (e.g. $K$ traveling at absolute speed $v$, a fraction of the speed constant emrgent from orbital and bouncing closed-loop patterns):

In one direction:

$c - v$

In the other direction:

$c + v$

Then averaging the two in a bi-directional measurement, as (correct me if I'm wrong) is usually done in speed-of-light-constancy measurements:

$\frac{(c - v) + (c + v)}{2} = c$

despite the relative speed of light not being constant in both directions from reference frame $K$ perspective, nor constant with respect to any other reference frames of velocity $v' \neq \pm v$, assuming Galilean additive velocities and a Galilean ordinary absolute reference frame.
