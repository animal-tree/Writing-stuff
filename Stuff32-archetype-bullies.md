it’s interesting when archetypes write based on stereotypes instead of memory. 

They have access to all of your inner hippocampal and maybe even genetic memory. But they somehow tap into a part of your brain that is stereotype-ridden, just a short-form memory bank of societal not-even-accurate not-even-useful-if-used-in-earnesty stereotypes. It comes in handy if they want to bully you or mock you or cause you to act foolish or become humiliated. It’s really confounding when applied in a collective consciousness setting that is really important to someone. It makes me suspect that there are bullies in the archetypal unconscious that want to mock me, instead of to genuinely teach me. 

And to genuinely teach me — is to know what it is I know and don’t know before beginning the humiliating lesson! Sometimes I just spent years unlearning the very thing you’re trying to teach me!

that's not to say we shouldn't integrate both. However, the point about knowing what the other person knows and doesn't know stands. If what you're teaching them is below what they know, then that is what I mean by archetypes writing from stereotypes instead of hippocampal and genetic memory. "you're" in this context is the governing Gods of the collective consciousness who facilitate, but don't rule the physical world in perfect harmony with the higher God, the one true God, me, billy bob junior. Anyway.
