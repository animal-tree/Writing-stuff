I can't be indebted. that's insane. the university of rochester took my life from me and left me with nothing except my mom. now i have to pay my student debts to them, after doctors working for them put me through multiple unnecessary and preventable physical and mental traumas, and the univerity terminated me for only publishing 2 paper in 3 years under Chenliang, while committee member changed and left during my PhD through no fault of my own, due to the pressure of the AI field to publish more often.
