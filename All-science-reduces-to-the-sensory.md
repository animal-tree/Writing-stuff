$P(B \vert E) = \frac{P(E \vert B) P(B)}{P(E)}$

This is the Bayesian belief equation.

Our knowledge of a truth depends on evidence. Evidence cannot be known in full certainty. Neither can the derived truth. We can premise beliefs on conditions that we call axioms. These are the foundation for math. In math, the assumption that certain conditions are true allows us to say, under a strict set of laws, meaning rules given non-divergent probabilities of 1, that certain deductions are true, of course the assumptions, including all the rules, are a belief themselves.

The probability of a belief given evidence is denoted by this equation and can be proven by a set of laws assumed to be true jointly. Their probabilities multiply to 1, under the assumption of the math used to describe them. And so the recursion goes.

The laws of natural numbers, for example, are derived from nature and assumed to be true with a probability of 1. 2 sticks in two hands makes two sticks. Add a rock and now you have two sticks and a rock. 

This describes an ontological world of parts and relations whose behaviors have defined tendencies known as physics. Our beliefs then derive arithmetic and so forth to describe these observations, that our senses and memories give us. Furthermore, we trust in our fellow companions to communicate, through their own symbolic means, their own sense and memory observations.

What we trust depends on that belief model and the probabilities our brains assign different evidence and different modes of interpreting that evidence A.K.A. an epistemology.

That’s what artificial intelligence is: it’s the epistemology of reasoning about the ontology that is the world, and our decisions in it.

One of the key facets of artificial intelligence is the objective function that guides the learning process. In symbolic AI reasoning, the objective is defined by the human and rules are programmed that help meet that objective. Goal-based action by a human, to facilitate tool-creation. Those tools however can have their own goals, when sufficiently advanced. This is the premise of numerical optimization, where a model, like a neural network, learns to optimize, or maximize or minimize, some set of constraints: a teleology.

Telos refers to the spirit. Teleology refers to causal purpose. Why the parameters of a neural network change can be attributed to the teleology of an objective function.

Why a species evolves can be attributed to the teleology of its survival.

Why the universe functions as it does can be, in primitive thought, attributed to great mystery and grand purpose, cosmological happenings beyond conception, that move the galaxies and raise and set the sun.

In more modern thought, we understand the universe to have a causal mechanism of fundamental forces and interactions between elementary particles attributed to the ontology and no epistemology beyond the interpretation of intelligent lifeforms.

The existence of elementary particles is observed by our most trusted institutions, and forces of interaction repeatedly reproduced. Therefore, through this consistency, between our own experiences and what we have observed from others and ourselves, we conclude that indeed the universe is so.

The teleology, as to why it is the way it is, is dismissed in favor of the causal “how”. How does it transition from point $t$ to point $t + 1$. The standard equation describes this mechanistic process, but does not give a clue as to why that process isn’t something totally different. Its origins can be traced, down to negligible times from origin, at least as far as can be determined by observation, and beyond that the question halts.

We cannot describe the system beyond its observability. We cannot determine where it halts backwards in time, no more than when a computer might halt forward in time given a program. The program can be immeasurably precise in its calculations, but no matter how good the model, the line of sight beyond its execution cannot be observed.

Within the system of math, it is the same. Gödel showed that a theorem always exists that cannot be proven. He used a self-referential theorem to make this point. Of course, though Gödel did not show this, an external body of math could be introduced to refer to that proof process, but then that external body would need its own external body and so on, resulting in a “turtles all the way down” logic, and naturally that is the best our logic affords to explain the origin of the universe, even with the wisdoms and insight of the Big Bang theory.

In other words, a simple answer as to “why” the universe exists is because another universe produced it. And so on. 

Another is infinite recursion. Our universe ends at the beginning, producing itself upon collapse. The wheel of time.

Religious views have held these ideas for centuries. The universe exists because God created it, the universe rests on the back of a thousand turtles, the universe is a patterned cosmic wheel that starts where it ends (the snake that eats its tail) in infinite cyclic fashion of eternal recurrence, etc.

$\Omega_T = \Omega_0$. (infinite recurrence)

These views have been interpreted by countless religions in countlessly romantic, terrifying, and otherwise characterizations. Nietzsche’s “eternal recurrence” thought experiment presents the notion as terrifying, spawned by a demon invading his nightmares. In Hindu Samsara, in Buddhist karmic wheel, there are similar interpretations.

In fact, there is one that does not have to be so scary. It will be described in an equation that is meant to be optimistic:

$\lim_{T \to +\infty} \Omega_T = \Omega_0$. (conservation theory)

The origin of the universe is thus explained by the infinite recursion of an infinitely horizon’d universe.

In this interpretation, the universe may create itself one day and therefore can exist, but tomorrow remains unknowable and its doom can always be procrastinated.

Nevertheless, in the infinitum, this equation creates the universe, without logical contradiction or a “Turtles all the way down” logic, much as the infinite recursion theory explains it, but without the fears of Samsara, and eternal recurrence. Mathematically, it tracks. It also weighs much less on the soul.

It is still bizarre to fathom why a recurrent self-creation would pop into being, even if it did create itself? 

Besides these 3 cosmogonical explanations, there is no theory within logic that explains the cosmogonical origin of the universe. However, that does not exclude a fourth. The fourth to add to the list, is that beyond this reality of logic, there is one entirely without it in which, for example, those condensed energies at the start of the Big Bang could just magically arise. 

Why did something else not pop into being? Where are those universes, if they exist? Can they connect to ours? What are the odds something so ordered, that can be described by a single standard-model equation, would be what pops into being, if literally anything at all could? Such an ontology of particles in 3D space, in gravitational 4D spacetime, is surreal to give weight to random chance at the start of the Big Bang when the condensed energies were already behaving in suspiciously precise ways, according to suspiciously specific hard-coded laws. Yet beyond that horizon, if there is a beyond, we cannot see.

We can however speculate.

It is possible the existing laws “evolved” from a hyperreality, without logic, out of the scope of abrupt universes that, due to inconsistencies within their own logics, couldn’t survive. Ours perhaps developed something by random chance that allowed it to, in time, reach a set of laws that today function stably as our known laws of physics, but which were not, at one point, stable.

In this evolution hypothesis, survival can be interpreted as a reality-teleology. One purpose that is consistent with the three logic-based cosmogonic explanations, is the purpose to, eventually[^1], create itself. That would have to be an innate purpose of the universe for it to be able to exist in coincidence with logic, without relying on suspect "turtles all the way down" recurrence or attributing solely to magic. 

[^1]: Eventually can mean along any "time" dimension t, not necessarily ours; heck, it could mean the cyclic boundaries of space/spacetime, hence "curvedness".
