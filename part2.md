While the truth of the matter is that fire is indeed composed of water,  water vapor, in "electrified" form, the deeper truth is that it's also a mix of many other gasses and poisons. Fire should not be romanticized. It's not water with sparkles. It's a dangerous, conflagurating technology that has led to the devastation of mankind.

Is that too extreme? Was the position that "fire is water" not extreme enough for you? Don't worry, we got you covered.

Fire is a tool that has led to the development of human civilization. From the splitting of the hydrocarbon to the splitting of the atom. Soon, the fusions of hydrogens and deuteriums and tritiums. But not without cost to the beauty of nature. Let me explain.

"Nature is a tool. We should hack and saw and chizzle it until we subdue and it's subdued into submission!" - that is the philosophy of the time.

Nature is not a tool andjust because we can, just because it's powerful, doesn't mean it's good. Not always.

Fire is devastating. No doubt about that. But in the scope of human history, it has proven to be one of our closest most essential friends. Nature governs us with the understanding that fire is part and parcel with humankind. But we revere that tool. We treat it as the centerpeice (bonfires), we roast marshmellows over it and tell each other drunkenly we love each other. That's good. And we hold it sacred in some way.

But as technology advances, it becomes more and more distinguishable from magic. "Ah, but that's heresy! Everyone knows fire is magic and any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic. Everyone knows that!"

No, as technology progresses it becomes more distinguishable from magic. Fire is just formulas by the way, your drunken love admissions are influxes of GABA neurotransmitter with some lucky boost of oxytocin.

Is that 100% reality? 

Anyway, that technology looks less like magic and more like lies. At that point, we have to consider whether it's possible to recharacterize.

But what worries me actually is that much of it, despite being esteemed by the highest of the highest in our society, is unecessary.

We can get by with solar.

We might have to sacrifice Snickers bars, maybe, but most of what we want and need can be delivered with pure solar. Maybe some Elon-Musk shingles.

The point is, splitting the atom is a lot work. It also makes nature kind of ugly. Fusing it is even more work, and automating that is even further off. All that manpower and money and time could be used to gaurentee everyone everything: family and friends and home and love and food and drink and community and sex and oxytocin and spirit. Magic. We could be giving ourselves magic. Today. We're powerful enough.
