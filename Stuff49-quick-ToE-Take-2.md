### Theory - Take 2

Perhaps each corpuscle is localized according to a probability distribution (say, mixture of Gaussians). And each sampled collision increases the likelihood at that point. Each truncation "absorbs" the likelihood into the other points — averaging the truncated values into the untruncated values.

This averaging — or "drift" — can be responsible for gravity.

Meanwhile, the truncation explains wave function collapse and the double-slit experiments.

The reason for this variational multi-trajectory sampling and probability averaging is non-local trajectory optimization and differentiability, so that the universe may optimize qualia (or leave this autonomous process to be autonomous).

Chaotic/pattern-independent drifts are gravity. They are themselves an energy source and therefore may account for hypothetical dark energy.

Pattern drifts are electromagnetism. They become patterned when polarity-aligned corpuscle orbitals (charges) collide (as upon acceleration). They are essentially patterned gravity and can cause attraction or repulsion due to a difference in how the probability distributions are averaged, and a photoelectric effect emitting the absorbed acceleration energy.

Since each corpuscle travels at the same speed, relative time is differentiated by an angular-linear velocity tradeoff that gives rise to special and general relativity, while assuming Galilean relativity.

Each corpuscle is essentially a photon. No aether is assumed.

Certain $\mu_{p,k}$ (means of the Gaussian mixture) are entangled across corpuscles, and interdependently truncated. This entanglement across collisions is qualia and creates singularized qualia, or consciousness.

Ultimately, it is like this for differentiability/optimizability, as the universe is constrained to limited compute. It is a minimalist solution for recursive improvement of qualia, a pre-existing but limited axiomatic/cosmogenic/teleological/self-creating property of reality.
