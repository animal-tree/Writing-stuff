They didn't even credit me for the fact that the graduate student association official student group began unionizing and petitioning for W2 workers status for grad students after my emails, in the public eye, by an official U of R organization. Until that month, no official group had led an effort. There the the University of Rochester grad Student Union, that I oroiginally helped start and even made their website. There was th UR Grad Collective, who were doing really good work, but were not affiliated with the university. But a month after my emails, the formal Graduate Student Association (led by elected graduate students), began for the first time making unionization and W2 workers status efforts and petitions. I think that had to do with my public emails. I could be wrong, maybe it was a big coincidnece. But for the first time, in the same month, those movements became officially recognized. I'm glad I contributed to that, in all likelihood, but I'll never get credit. And now I'm going to make this GitHub private so that no one has to be humiliated or have their job lost, in case I'm successful in my physics derivations. If needed, I'll make this GitHub public since it records chronologies, which might turn out relevant to the controversial points I'm making. I reserve the right to change my mind on all of this.
