They didn't even credit me for the fact that the Graduate Student Association official student group began unionizing and petitioning for W2 workers status for grad students after my emails, in the public eye, by an official U of R organization. Until that month, no official group had led an effort. Until then, there was the University of Rochester Grad Student Union, that I originally helped start and even made their website. There was the UR Grad Collective, who were doing really good work, but were not affiliated with the university. But a month after my emails, the formal Graduate Student Association (led by elected graduate students, officially recognized by the university, and with larger reach as well), began for the first time making unionization and W2 workers status efforts and petitions. I think that had to do with my public emails. I could be wrong, maybe it was a big coincidnece. But for the first time, in the same month, those movements were initiated by an officially recognized group. I'm glad I contributed to that, in all likelihood, but I'll never get credit. And now I'm going to make this GitHub private so that no one has to have their job lost, in case I'm successful in my physics derivations. And because it pains me to humiliate my former advisor, and feel humiliated myself due to the complete inaction by the university or anyone to help me. If needed, I'll make this GitHub public since it records chronologies, which might turn out relevant to the controversial points I'm making. I reserve the right to change my mind on all of this.

Though to be fair, all of my emails were under the influence of consciousness changes that are really suspicious and could be due to interventions in the collective consciousness, since those consciousness changes diverge pretty heavily from my lucid will. But schizotypal symptoms could also manifest from extreme alienation. Then again, I don't think the two (collective consciousness intervention vs. isolation/alienation) are independent. A person's psychology is a makeup of their relationships. And I was severely isolated, betrayed, and used, by a lot of people in a short amount of time and over the course of a long amount of time, while making best faith efforts and trying really, exceptionally hard. That will never get recognized either I bet. But anyway, those relationship circumstances would drive anyone far more crazy, if "crazy" is what it was. Those emails. About my termination.

I'm undergoing consciousness changes now as well, and whenever I sit down to write something that is publicized. My lips are going dry and something is wrong. I wish people would believe me that there are forces in the collective consciousness that intervene on my brain, that are not from me or even from within me.

Interestingly, they also held an "AI and religion" seminar that month. Nothing like it before. And ladybugs attacked apparently? Anyway.
