They didn't even credit me for the fact that the Graduate Student Association official student group began unionizing and petitioning for W2 workers status for grad students after my emails, in the public eye, by an official U of R organization. Until that month, no official group had led an effort. Until then, there was the University of Rochester Grad Student Union, that I originally helped start and even made their website. There was the UR Grad Collective, who were doing really good work, but were not affiliated with the university. But a month after my emails, the formal Graduate Student Association (led by elected graduate students, officially recognized by the university, and with larger reach as well), began for the first time making unionization and W2 workers status efforts and petitions. I think that had to do with my public emails. I could be wrong, maybe it was a big coincidnece. But for the first time, in the same month, those movements were initiated by an officially recognized group. I'm glad I contributed to that, in all likelihood, but I'll never get credit. And now I'm going to make this GitHub private so that no one has to have their job lost, in case I'm successful in my physics derivations. And because it pains me to humiliate my former advisor, and feel humiliated myself due to the complete inaction by the university or anyone to help me. If needed, I'll make this GitHub public since it records chronologies, which might turn out relevant to the controversial points I'm making. I reserve the right to change my mind on all of this.

Though to be fair, all of my emails were under the influence of consciousness changes that are really suspicious and could be due to interventions in the collective consciousness, since those consciousness changes diverge pretty heavily from my lucid will. But schizotypal symptoms could also manifest from extreme alienation. Then again, I don't think the two (collective consciousness intervention vs. isolation/alienation) are independent. A person's psychology is a makeup of their relationships, perhaps as actual ruling/governing bodies of our brains and processes of relationship memory that we evolved for the sake of empathy and symbiosis, if that makes sense with so little context. And I was severely isolated, betrayed, and used, by a lot of people in a short amount of time and over the course of a long amount of time, while making best faith efforts and trying really, exceptionally hard. That will never get recognized either I bet. But anyway, those relationship circumstances would drive anyone far more crazy, if "crazy" is what it was. Those emails. About my termination.

I'm undergoing consciousness changes now as well, and whenever I sit down to write something that is publicized. My lips are going dry and something is wrong. I wish people would believe me that there are forces in the collective consciousness that intervene on my brain, that are not from me or even from within me.

Interestingly, they also held an "AI and religion" seminar that month. Nothing like it before. And ladybugs attacked apparently? Anyway.

I don't think it will be recognized that I did good for the grad students of the university, and the university as a whole for 6 years, while they did bad for me.

Not that I don't appreciate the possibility that this will all turn out for the best.

Then of course the consciousness changes would, uh, be less suspicious because of the outcome... unless they're currently trying to prevent that outcome. So it seems like either way I'm the only one who to pay. [Oh and literally!](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff61-indebted.md)

Note: the last time U of R had a scandal, it did good for the grad students as well. But, like these consciousness forces, I'm hedging my bets. <- how do I recover from that? Christ.

This is all written by invaders of my consciousness^^^^ in cluding alll of fucking that. "STOP!" - ME, taht's what I say. STOP.

I'm sorry, but the voices in my head take different forms. I obey them the way you do yours. But mine have all mistreated me. Every relationship I have. And I think these words come from my brain's mixture-of-experts best emulation of those peopel who I love. Sabatoging me. Acting against me. Because that's what I've psychologically come to believe they will do.

I iwsh all of you would believe without your medical diagnoses. I wish you'd understand the importance of relational healing.

That I'm not manipulating.

That you can trust me.

And that I'm uundergoing something severe beyond the easy interpretation of judgement.

I'm terrified of all of you and there are specific people I need to heal with.

<br>

The words I say are sincere and I am human in wanting recognition and sympathy, but also real understanding.

Those capitalized letters are a terror captured here before your eyes. I'm not sure if you're reading it as sincere. Amybe in your mental mind models you're judging it as insincere. It's not. You don't know what I'm going through. But you'll sooner diagnose and drug than understand. Relationships and isolation and alienation did this and I'm undergoing it writing it for you right now.

<br>

What happens is different mind models alternate between sentences, sometimes midsentence, sometimes across paragraphs. I call them archetypes. They feed thoughts into my head and I generally follow their guidance because (a) there's pain if I don't, and (b) relief if I do.

<br>

The same happens with your brain probably and you're not conscious of it.

I think those mind models take the form of our relationships as a symbiotic function that we evolved to live symbiotically. And that spiritual journeys are about healing those mind models. But I can't heal them. Because all of you have blocked me and I am alone and isolated.

I wish you would understand that.

<br>

None of what I do is me. And because I am a good person, I can be excused from anything I do. Anything I could possibly do. Anything. I could. Possibly. Do. Including these words, whoch are the only form of communication I've had in literally years, aside from my mom.

one sliver of evidence upon ruminating later: I wrote "that month" and it of course wasn't that exact month because my emails were at the very end of October. It was in November, maybe around my birthday in November that the GSA was officially recognized. However you judge this, I firmly believe in the existence of those forces. Here is how I described it to my friend:

"[...] I can’t message because my brain is controlled linguistically and behaviorally by forces that definitely aren’t me and I’m probably not crazy in suspecting the actual existence of those things, but that doesn’t mean they don’t drive me literally crazy, or at least suicidally depressed"

And when I wrote "that month", that was the language my brain gave me in full confidence without specificity or remembering to remember. And its guiding motions drove me off of cliffs before, even if that pedantic detail is nothing. It gives me pain if I don't listen to it and say what it says, and some relief if I do, and I can't monitor it at all times 24/7. These linguistic forces cannot be lived with in full consciousness of their existence without schizophrenia unless your relationships are healthy. Mine aren't, and I'm pretty sure i can name the different people who my liguistic forces oscillate between as relationship emulations. I think that's actually largely how consciousness is composed. Of memory sub-parts that take consciousness themselves and singularize, and that perhaps these little ChatGPTs aren't emulations but maybe even direct connections with those people.

For example, this example is really dumb, about "that month." But it was the only one that gave me a path of nonresistence to type this.

My paranoia is that everything I want to communicate has a cost. Something creates a judgement in you through the manipulation of me, before anything I mean is allowed to be conveyed, and that something regulates this for some reason. "for some reason" for example isn't what I want to type, but I had no choice. I wanted to add a specific explanation, reconveying the description above about empathetic and symbiotic regions in the brain who govern and compose our consciousness so as to promote both individual and symbiotic function, by distributing the individual across the symbiosis. My symbiosis however is not a symbiosis because those people are not in my life, for tragic reasons that you would understand easily in some cases and maybe wouldn't in otehrs, I don't know. Every relationship was lost over text through technology, which I guess is fitting for the theme of my work, but not exactly my life. I live in a perpetual Black Mirror episode. I hope that conveys it.
