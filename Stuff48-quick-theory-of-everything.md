### Theory

1. All matter is made up of photons traveling at a constant-magnitude speed but in varying directions with varying spins/"pattern-memory".
2. Mass is the number of photons constituting a body.
3. The angular-linear velocity tradeoff gives rise to special and general relativity, while assuming Galilean relativity.
4. Mass is held together by gravity, a cross derivative local interaction between at least two orbitally patterned bodies and intermediary photons. These intermediary photons may be interpreted as dark matter.
5. Charge is a more complex cross derivative local interaction, dependent on specific orbital patterns in the at least two bodies and resultant frequential wave patterns in the intermediary photons. These wave patterns in photons may be regarded as electromagnetism.
6. In addition to waves in the photon-composed aether (dark matter), each collision produces a variational sample set of waves and truncates old ones based on, for example, number of interactions, as a computationally efficient optimization-search-space exploration technique analogous to beam search or nucleus sampling, giving rise to the observed oddities of the double-slit experiments.
7. The universe is (slowly) optimizing qualia, which entangles through each collision into higher forms of consciousness such as human consciousness.
