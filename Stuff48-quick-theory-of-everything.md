i think everything is photons and light is wave patterns — frequential patterns — in photons — and dark matter is unpatterned photons (chaos) — and charge is orbital patterns (in photon motion) that are very circular — while mass is orbital patterns (in photon motion) that are self-contained but less perfectly rotational, perhaps helical or simply disordered but stable.

Those orbits are of the photons themselves, not the waves! Or else light would have charge.

They also depend on sufficiently fast speed and small scale so as to align the quantum gearboxes at the photon level. Rotating just about anything wouldn't produce a noticeable charge since the massive bodies would rotate in such a way that would not significantly change the relative rotational patterns of the photons within.

All are traveling at an instantaneous velocity of $c$; however that velocity can manifest linearly or angularly.

As the angular velocity of the photons composing massive bodies is traded for linear velocity — that is, closer to light speeds are attained — the internals of those bodies either slows down due to the loss of angular speed ("time-dilate") or break down and scatter into subatomic units and photons. In the former case is why we have special relativity, and time dilation attributed to velocity.

Photon orbital systems compose different types of elementary particles. They are glued, attracted, or repulsed based on their own orbital patterns that alter the substituent photons' "spin" and the resulting interaction with surrounding dark matter distinguished by their own pattern-dependent "spin". A photon is thus minimally describable as a 3D velocity (localized at a position) with a 3D spin that keeps track of its "memory" to sufficiently distinguish it depending on its super-system's orbital pattern(s) or chaos.

For optimization reasons, the collision outcomes of photons aren't perfectly determined. By sampling multiple trajectories (wave-particle duality), the qualia of the universe (by a limited decider) can be maximized, while the vast majority of the work and computational resources can be left autonomous due to a finite capacity necessity. Each collision is a qualia and entangles into higher qualia such as singularized human consciousness. These entanglements collapse and are sampled based on a heuristic of the number of collisions (entanglements via wave-particle duality) and the qualia of the limited decider.

Way philosophical cosmogenesis: where did photons and qualia come from? They are probably just one observer observing itself whose definition is the definition of definition.
