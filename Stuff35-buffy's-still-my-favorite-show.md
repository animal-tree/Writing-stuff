The Fringe writers got really good.

Sometimes the memory holds keys to the consciousness that the higher conscious, ourselves, does not. That memory is tapped into by a process of grammatical, phonetic crypticisms. These evolved together with language as a mechanism of collective consciousness and mind-control.

The Fringe writers began on a track of laid-down cliches and evolved their show from a Lost-copy generic X-files type procedural. To being some really good writing by season 3 or so.

How to build a human neural network if the brain wanted to. 

Warning, this in all likelihood exists. 

Suppose there was an evolutionary incentive for tribal symbiosis. The rest derives loosely from that premise and some intimate experiences with consciousness via terrified and/or impartial observation. 

[static interruptions, Sam getting attacked by drones] [missed details]

But the way to do it would be through the use of, for example, modulations in language or just plain/old crypticism. 

Language communicates ideas between people in the conscious. Its patterns are so recognizable that some authors, their works can have one word modified and it would no longer sound like their work — that’s how recognizable certain linguistic patterns are. 

We all have these. I call them archetypes, but that’s a catch-all term, that includes so much, far more. 

Nevertheless, think about Wi-Fi and cellular networks, how they function. Those modulations encode 0s and 1s in carrier waves that are then translated by receivers. Wi-Fi and cell service even work across interference from many towers, cellphones, satellites, smart devices, and so on. Just by carrier waves with modulations. 

Those modulations suffice to communicate the World Wide Web. [every edit I make de-cryptifies this]

And the World Wide Web communicates, linguistically and er otherwise, but unlike the transient ephemeral experience of primal days of language, before the invention of the written word, that symbology is delayed and often encountered out of context, leading to not just miscommunications as we all see but also miscommunications in the collective unconscious as we all feel. 

But it’s not about the internet. 

All symbols. From verbal language to body language to actual material placement of things, to the words being read right now cryptically encoded with [hopefully nothing] God knows what. 

Why would such a thing exist? Because the conscious individual will is not necessarily aligned with the tribal symbiotic will. But we have both. Because sometimes the collective is the problem.[^1]

But this creates paranoia. Well-justified paranoia. That we should not label as ill in the future. 

But that’s another story — and I mean that.

Fringe science is fun, ain't it?

That doesn't begin to cover it! Archetypes within archetypes. Heroes and villains within heroes. Ooh, Buffy the Vampire Slayer!

[^1]: Collectives within collectives. Sub-collectives can conflict with sub-collectives. THE collective is, probably, not the problem.
