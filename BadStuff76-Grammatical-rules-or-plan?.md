Grammatical rules or plan, responsible for my radical sudden but not randomly-timed consciousness changes? If they were random and didn't serve attributable interests of others, I'd reason I was going crazy or --

I forgot what I was saying. I had the thought in my head. Now it's gone. I had a specific character in my head whose voice seemed to steer the thought, now it's gone.

Mind control tactics used by maybe collective consciousness, maybe these aforementioned demons 

1.	Re-prioritization: things that are less important seem more important than things that are more important 
2.	Re-contextualization: memory associations are threaded to give something good the character of bad, and something bad the character of good
3.	Illness and debilitation: physiological and mental conditions are created to suppress opposition and reenforce obedience 
4.	Linguistic manipulation: the communicator’s words are modulated and mis-remembered selectively to change subtext and influence social perceptions
5.	Tone and presentation manipulation: the communicator’s sound and body language are modulated to change subtext and influence social perceptions
6.	Forgetting: feelings and understandings are forgotten
7.	Absurdity: a feeling exists that can make the truest things just seem absurd to the point that no one would even consider or weigh them in their emotional or rational thinking
8.	Withholding: things we want are promised but not given and perpetually dangled as carrots to perpetuate obedience
