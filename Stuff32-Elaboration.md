Okay, we've gotten a construct for time and an unhalting Turing machine that presumably eventually (or somehow) cycles back to its origin starting state. We got this from hacking the definition of equivalence. We will take a step back now and derive it a little more formally. It is stupid, but perhaps there's nothing stopping us from doing this re-defining and obtaining a deductive logic from which cosmogenesis could theoretically make sense, noting: the Big Bang Theory is not a cosmogenesis theory and chronicles the early moments and evolution of the observable beginning of the universe. An un-mythological cosmogenesis theory has, perhaps, yet to be proposed in the scope of deduction. Myths, such as my favorite being Tolkien's cosmogenesis allegory (yes it is an allegory) of the universe arising from a musical theme, do exist and perhaps have extreme truth to them, all.

**Definition 1.** $($ Axiom  $A ) =_1 (\exists A)$.

**Definition 2.** $($ Definition $A = B) =_1 (\exists (A = B))$. 

**Definition 3.** $($ Equivalence $A = B) =_1 (A \rightarrow_n B, B \rightarrow_m A, n, m \in \mathbb{N})$, where $n, m$ are deductive steps, meaning $n, m$ statements must be deduced between $A$ and $B$ and $B$ and $A$ respectively. $A =_1 B$ substitutes the traditional equality operator:

Traditional equivalence $(A =_1 B) = (A \rightarrow_1 B, B \rightarrow_1 A)$.

For example, $(A \rightarrow_2 B) = (A \rightarrow_1 o \rightarrow_1 B)$ for some mandatory intermediary $o$.

**Definition 4.** $($ Implication $A \rightarrow_1 B) =_1 (\exists A \rightarrow_1 \exists B)$.

**Definition 5.** $($ Deduction/proof $A \rightarrow_n B) =_1 (\exists A \rightarrow_n \exists B)$.

$A$ and $B$ are any statement whose contents and operators are defined. Philosophically, it's hard to gauge how to define that. They merely "are". Placeholders. Variables algebraically substituting something more defined. Anything defined.

Traditional equivalence is fully generalized to by this more-general definition of equivalence, meaning any previous use of equivalence may, to the best of our ability to tell, be substituted with this new one.

Likewise, any implication $A \rightarrow B$ can be substituted with $A \rightarrow_n B$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ w.l.o.g..
