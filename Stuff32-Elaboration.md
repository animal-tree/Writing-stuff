Okay, we've gotten a construct for time and an unhalting Turing machine that presumably eventually (or somehow) cycles back to its origin starting state. We got this from hacking the definition of equivalence. We will take a step back now and derive it a little more formally. It is stupid, but perhaps there's nothing stopping us from doing this re-defining and obtaining a deductive logic from which cosmogenesis could theoretically make sense, noting: the Big Bang Theory is not a cosmogenesis theory and chronicles the early moments and evolution of the observable beginning of the universe. An un-mythological cosmogenesis theory has, perhaps, yet to be proposed in the scope of deduction. Myths, such as my favorite being Tolkien's cosmogenesis allegory (yes it is an allegory) of the universe arising from a musical theme, do exist and perhaps have extreme truth to them, all.

**Definition 1.** Axiom $A$ is true. Or, $\exists A$.

**Axiom 1.** A definition $A = B$ is true. 

**Definition 2.** Equivalence $A = B$ means $A \rightarrow_n B$ and $B \rightarrow_m A$ in $n, m \in \mathbb{N}$ deductive steps.

**Definition 3.** Implication $A \rightarrow_1 B$ means that if $A$ is true, $B$ is true upon the immediate next deductive step.

**Definition 4.** Deduction/proof $A \rightarrow_n B$ means that if $A$ is true, $B$ is true upon $n$ deductive steps.

We have now defined proof.

This definition, while hacky, generalizes to every other definition and deductive process.
