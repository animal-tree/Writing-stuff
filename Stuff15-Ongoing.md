Let's start with nothing.

$\emptyset$.

From nothing, let's build the ground up.

Here's a fact: $\mathrm{I}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, 

where $\mathrm{I}$ is the Identify function.

And another: $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}) = \mathrm{I}$.

Great, we can now compose them. Let $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\cdot))$ represent a $0$ and $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\cdot)$ represent a $1$.

Great, we've now emerged representation. $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\emptyset))))$ = 011.

Let's endow it with qualitative subscripts. We can express $\mathrm{I}$ in multiple identities:

$\mathrm{I}_1(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, $\mathrm{I}_2(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, $\mathrm{I}_1(\mathrm{I}_2) = \mathrm{I}_2$, ...

$\mathrm{I}_1$ is the Identity function just as much as $\mathrm{I}_2$. We are defining a new set of functionally indistinguishable Identity functions. 

$\mathrm{Q} = \mathrm{I}_\mathbb{N}$

We will refer to this set as Qualia.

Since we are within a mathematical system, we also have access to one more axiom: Causality, the rules of deduction. But let us treat it as a hypothetical.

In deduction, every deductive step is defined to have a deductive cause, except the base causes. Those are called axioms, which we have avoided establishing thus far. That is the definition. $\mathrm{I}$ and $\emptyset$ also behave as definitions. $\emptyset$ especially is abstract, representing symbolically "nothing".

But what may be the deductive cause for deduction and the deductive step if it is not assumed as an axiom? Equivalently, "what may cause causality?" Perhaps:

1. It caused itself (it deduces itself)
2. Something else caused it (it is the byproduct of an external mathematical framework)
3. Its existence is unjustified by a cause (it is an axiom)

Since there is no second mathematical system that would not contain itself, and the non-assumption that it is not an axiom, 2 and 3 are impossible. This leaves 1: self-deduction. This deduction must eventually deduce itself.

We can interpret two possible self-deductions:

1. One where the deductive steps are cyclical: $\Omega_T = \Omega_0$ for the number of deductive steps $T$.
2. Or $\lim_{t \to +\infty} \Omega_t = \Omega_0$, an infinite "series", or much like one, where the deductive steps may eventually, in their infinitum, deduce themselves.

Either way, the proof is further constrained. For example, we are not allowed to establish an axiom now that says, "here forth there will be no more deducable deductions." Presumably, some number of deductive steps in the future, with enough paths considered, would lead to the deduction of deduction, or else it would have to be assumed as an axiom.

Otherwise, it can be a self-referential theorem, or definition.

Since this hypothetical proof is a representation, let us define a pattern representation of 1s and 0s, a Turing-complete representation system, to describe it $k = \langle 0, 1 \rangle^n$.

More specifically, let us use, with Qualia, our representation of 1s and 0s, some undefined representation, to do so: 

$\Omega = \lim_{i, n \to +\infty} \mathrm{I}_i^n(\emptyset)$.

Since it is ongoing, we may define a deductive present $n = t$. 

And now we may redefine the present: $n = t + 1$.

And so on, denoting the current derivation step $n$. ($n = t + 2$)

Thus, our recursive representation, $\Omega$, is finite, composed $n$ times.
