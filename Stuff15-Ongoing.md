Let's start with nothing.

$\emptyset$.

From nothing, let's build the ground up.

Here's a fact: $\mathrm{I}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, 

where $\mathrm{I}$ is the Identify function.

And another: $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}) = \mathrm{I}$.

Great, we can now compose them. Let $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\cdot))$ represent a $0$ and $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\cdot)$ represent a $1$.

Great, we've now emerged representation. $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\emptyset))))$ = 011.

Let's endow it with qualitative subscripts. We can express $\mathrm{I}$ in multiple identities:

$\mathrm{I}_1(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, $\mathrm{I}_2(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, $\mathrm{I}_1(\mathrm{I}_2) = \mathrm{I}_2$, ...

$\mathrm{I}_1$ is the Identity function just as much as $\mathrm{I}_2$. We are defining a new set of functionally indistinguishable Identity functions. 

$\mathrm{Q} = \mathrm{I}_\mathbb{N}$

We will refer to this set as Qualia.

Since we are within a mathematical system, we also have access to one more axiom: Causality, the rules of deduction. But let us treat it as a hypothetical.

In deduction, every deductive step is defined to have a deductive cause, except the base causes. Those are called axioms, which we have avoided establishing thus far. That is the definition. $\mathrm{I}$ and $\emptyset$ also behave as definitions. $\emptyset$ especially is abstract, representing symbolically "nothing".

But what may be the deductive cause for deduction and the deductive step if it is not assumed as an axiom? Equivalently, "what may cause causality?" Perhaps:

1. It caused itself (it deduces itself)
2. Something else caused it (it is the byproduct of an external mathematical framework)
3. Its existence is unjustified by a cause (it is an axiom)

Since there is no second mathematical system that would not contain itself, and the non-assumption that it is not an axiom, 2 and 3 are impossible. This leaves 1: self-deduction. This deduction must eventually deduce itself.

We can interpret two possible self-deductions:

1. One where the deductive steps are cyclical: $\Omega_T = \Omega_0$ for the number of deductive steps $T$.
2. Or $\lim_{t \to +\infty} \Omega_t = \Omega_0$, an infinite "series", or much like one, where the deductive steps may eventually, in their infinitum, deduce themselves.

Either way, the proof is further constrained. For example, we are not allowed to establish an axiom now that says, "here forth there will be no more deducable deductions." Presumably, some number of deductive steps in the future, with enough paths considered, would lead to the deduction of deduction, or else it would have to be assumed as an axiom.

Otherwise, it can be a self-referential theorem, or definition.

Since this hypothetical proof is a representation, let us define a pattern representation of 1s and 0s, a Turing-complete representation system, to describe it $k = \langle 0, 1 \rangle^n$.

More specifically, let us use, with Qualia, our representation of 1s and 0s, some undefined representation, to do so: 

$\Omega = \lim_{i, n \to +\infty} \mathrm{I}_i^n(\emptyset)$.

Since it is ongoing, we may define a deductive present $n = t$. 

And now we may redefine the present: $n = t + 1$.

And so on, denoting the current derivation step $n$. ($n = t + 2$)

Thus, our recursive representation, $\Omega$, is finite, composed $n$ times.

---

Since $\Omega$ represents deduction, all that is left is to draw an equivalence between $\Omega$ and our reality within which this mathematical system is taking place.

Self-causality demonstrates how our reality could create itself, and thereby this proof, with $\Omega$ as the representation, may be a hypothetical reference to the observable universe's meta-reality. To conclude the proof, we would need a reality, such as our own, in physical matter, to physically point to, not the mathematical symbol $\Omega$. However, by analogy, we can do just that.

Let's distinguish two Omegas. The Omega in this proof, $\hat{\Omega}$, that is a representation. And, hypothetically, the referent Omega that exists outside of the proof from which we, as provers, follow the mathematical steps of deduction: $\Omega$, physical reality.

We can now define $\hat{\Omega}$ as a physics model and aim to deduce $\hat{\Omega} = \Omega$ by sampling $\hat{\Omega}$ as a sufficiently probable physics model. This is the process of physics:

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y)$

where $\mathrm{R}$ is a recursive dynamics model and a random variable, $h$ is the hidden state (the non-observable universe) at any time point up to some conceivable horizon (in order to make $\mathrm{R}$ defined), composed $n$ times. $x$ is a singled out cause of interest[^1], $y$ is the observable universe.

---

If an $\mathrm{R}$ exists that is both true to observable reality and that this proof derives to, with observable probability in the infinitum, by its derivation observable bounds, as per the standard scientific method and evidence (p-values, null hypotheses, and correlations of model prediction) we have then concluded our proof, and proved the origin of the universe and its mechanism. To be continued...
