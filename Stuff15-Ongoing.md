Let's start with nothing.

$\emptyset$.

From nothing, let's build the ground up.

Here's a fact: $\mathrm{I}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, 

where $\mathrm{I}$ is the Identify function.

And another: $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}) = \mathrm{I}$.

Great, we can now compose them. Let $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\cdot))$ represent a $0$ and $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\cdot)$ represent a $1$.

Great, we've now emerged representation. $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\emptyset))))$ = 011.

Let's endow it with qualitative subscripts. We can express $\mathrm{I}$ in multiple identities:

$\mathrm{I}_1(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, $\mathrm{I}_2(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, $\mathrm{I}_1(\mathrm{I}_2) = \mathrm{I}_2$, ...

$\mathrm{I}_1$ is the Identity function just as much as $\mathrm{I}_2$. We are defining a new set of functionally indistinguishable Identity functions. 

$\mathrm{Q} = \mathrm{I}_\mathbb{N}$

We will refer to this set as Qualia.

Since we are within a mathematical system, we also have access to one more axiom: Causality, the rules of deduction. But let us treat it as a hypothetical.

In deduction, every deductive step is defined to have a deductive cause, except the base causes. Those are called axioms, which we have avoided establishing thus far. That is the definition. $\mathrm{I}$ and $\emptyset$ also behave as definitions. $\emptyset$ especially is abstract, representing symbolically "nothing".

But what may be the deductive cause for deduction and the deductive step if it is not assumed as an axiom? Equivalently, "what may cause causality?" Perhaps:

1. It caused itself (it deduces itself)
2. Something else caused it (it is the byproduct of an external mathematical framework)
3. Its existence is unjustified by a cause (it is an axiom)

Since there is no second mathematical system that would not contain itself, and the non-assumption that it is not an axiom, 2 and 3 are impossible. This leaves 1: self-deduction. This deduction must eventually deduce itself.

We can interpret two possible self-deductions:

1. One where the deductive steps are cyclical: $\Omega_T = \Omega_0$ for the number of deductive steps $T$.
2. Or $\lim_{t \to +\infty} \Omega_t = \Omega_0$, an infinite "series", or much like one, where the deductive steps may eventually, in their infinitum, deduce themselves.

Either way, the proof is further constrained. For example, we are not allowed to establish an axiom now that says, "here forth there will be no more deducable deductions." Presumably, some number of deductive steps in the future, with enough paths considered, would lead to the deduction of deduction, or else it would have to be assumed as an axiom.

Otherwise, it can be a self-referential theorem, or definition.

Since this hypothetical proof is a representation, let us define a pattern representation of 1s and 0s, a Turing-complete representation system, to describe it $k = \langle 0, 1 \rangle^n$.

More specifically, let us use, with Qualia, our representation of 1s and 0s, some undefined representation, to do so: 

$\Omega = \lim_{i, n \to +\infty} \mathrm{I}_i^n(\emptyset)$.

Since it is ongoing, we may define a deductive present $n = t$. 

And now we may redefine the present: $n = t + 1$.

And so on, denoting the current derivation step $n$. ($n = t + 2$)

Thus, our recursive representation, $\Omega$, is finite, composed $n$ times.

---

Since $\Omega$ represents deduction, all that is left is to draw an equivalence between $\Omega$ and our reality within which this mathematical system is taking place.

Self-causality demonstrates how our reality could create itself, and thereby this proof, with $\Omega$ as the representation, may be a hypothetical reference to the observable universe's meta-reality. To conclude the proof, we would need a reality, such as our own, in physical matter, to physically point to, not the mathematical symbol $\Omega$. However, by analogy, we can do just that.

Let's distinguish two Omegas. The Omega in this proof, $\hat{\Omega}$, that is a representation. And, hypothetically, the referent Omega that exists outside of the proof from which we, as provers, follow the mathematical steps of deduction: $\Omega$, physical reality.

We can now define $\hat{\Omega}$ as a physics model and aim to deduce $\hat{\Omega} = \Omega$ by sampling $\hat{\Omega}$ as a sufficiently probable physics model. This is the process of physics:

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y)$

where $\mathrm{R}$ is a recursive dynamics model and a random variable, $h$ is the hidden state (the non-observable universe) at any time point up to some conceivable horizon (in order to make $\mathrm{R}$ defined), composed $n$ times. $x$ is a singled out cause of interest[^1], $y$ is the observable universe.

---

If an $\mathrm{R}$ exists that is both true to observable reality and that this proof derives to, with observable probability in the infinitum, by its derivation observable bounds, as per the standard scientific method and evidence (p-values, null hypotheses, and correlations of model prediction) we have then concluded our proof, and proved the origin of the universe and its mechanism. 

First, let's be concrete about what these processes are.

**Physics:**

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y)$

where $\mathrm{R}$ is a recursive dynamics model and a random variable, $h$ is the hidden state (the non-observable universe) at any time point up to some conceivable horizon (in order to make $\mathrm{R}$ defined), composed $n$ times. $y$ is the observable universe.

**Causal reasoning:**

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y, \mathrm{R})$

$x$ is the cause, $y$ is the effect, under some dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$.

**Axiomatic math:**

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert h^{(n)}, n \in \mathcal{N}, \mathrm{R}, x, h^{(0)})$

where $\mathrm{R}$ is the rules of math. $y$ is a theorem or theorem set, $x$ is an axiom or axiom set. $\mathrm{R}$ is Turing-complete due its rewritable memory state $h$. Ordinarily, $\mathrm{R}$'s rules are deterministic, a side effect being that the probability of a theorem $y$ is also deterministic, $1$ or $0$. 

Non-deterministic math, e.g. an "Occam's razor" "theorem", we will refer to as epistemological math, rooted in belief.

**Belief:**

$\mathbf{P}(B \vert E) = \frac{\mathbf{P}(E \vert B)\mathbf{P}(B)}{\mathbf{P}(E)}$

Random variables are also useful to defining implications, causal derivation steps, and theorem-deduction steps, which are relevant to the end goal of this proof:

**Theorem-deduction steps:**

Random variables may be also expressed as relating other random variables, for example

$\mathbf{P}(x > y)$.

Furthermore, they can be used to express deduction steps. Transitivity of the greater-than inequality for example, using conditionals to specify the valid axioms or theorems $(x > y, y > z)$ that would imply the prior $x > z$.

$\mathbf{P}(x > z \vert x > y, y > z) = 1$

They may even be cross-referential:

$\mathbf{P}(w > z \vert w > x, \mathbf{P}(x > z \vert x > y, y > z) = 1) = 1$,

Treating each other as random variables.

Could such an ontology form the basis of a data structure to represent $R, h^{(0)}$ in axiomatic math? Using deterministic conditionals with probabilities $1$ as proof steps and a defined set of initial conditionals and beliefs (random variables), it seems so.

---

Furthermore, it can generalize to a new type of math where proof steps can be epistemological, non-deterministic beliefs applied to other beliefs to quantify a looser proof. This is standardly done in physical sciences with the use of p-values, and we draw a formal unambiguous connection between that to AI and reasoning generally, keeping these notations and formalities that tie together the larger sciences.

Physics, causality, and math have utility and correlative predictiveness to our memories and senses, but beyond observing what's in front of us, these established beliefs are symbolic references within the brain, and the referents are memories, observations, and beliefs. As René Descartes derived with "*cogito, ergo sum*": "I doubt, therefore I am," we can further deduce inwardly. If I may: 

"I observe, therefore I am observing, therefore I am. 

I observe many referents to my observation, including memories, feelings, and viscera. There's also belief. I believe X, Y, Z. I justify X, Y, Z by reasons, another element of belief, X', Y', Z'."

Each step is deeper into the psyche.

Physics, causality, and math are beliefs. 

Philosophy includes these meta-beliefs as well as others.

Perhaps, philosophically speaking, philosophy is the random variable set encompassing all random variables:

**Philosophy:**

$\langle B \vert (B \in \Omega) \sim \mathbf{P}(B \in \Omega) \rangle$,

though to define it as such would contradict that definition since a random variable set encompassing all random variables would have to be contained within itself, making the definition self-referentially undefined. This would be analogous to defining a word in a dictionary by some other words plus itself. Turtles-all-the-way-down is distinct from cyclicality. Gödel's theorem pertains to this. It says within a self-referential proof, [to be continued...]

---

By defining philosophy as a random variable set, we permit the question, "What is a random variable?" even as the set is defined as one of all random variables. Random variables include probability distributions, but what else might they include? That philosophical question remains a part of this recursive set non-definition.

Is the Schrödinger wave equation for example a random variable? Yes, it can be expressed as one.

What about art? It can be. A generator in a GAN is evidence and the mechanical properties of the brain suggest that it is.

What about consciousness? Ah, that's where no other math or language except philosophy can broach! And indeed the only way to do it is from the lens of belief and probability. This question itself can be expressed as: $P(c \in \Omega)$.

---

We have concluded our proof when we have shown our theorem deduction steps, random variables composing random variables, are equivalent to $\hat{\Omega}$, represented by Qualia, are models of $\Omega$.
