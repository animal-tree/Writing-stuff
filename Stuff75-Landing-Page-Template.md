*Intelligence exists plainly in nature. Love permeates all things.*

# AGI.\_\_init\_\_

In our code, we strive for:

- *Minimalism*
- *Beauty*
- *Pedagogical clarity*
- *SotA performance*

Python has something called [magic methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/). One of these is the ```__init__``` method, which initalializes a class. Try running the below:

```ruby
class AGI:
    """A General Intelligence"""

    def __init__(self):
        ...


print(f'{AGI.__init__} is a "magic method".')
```

*Output*:

```console
<function AGI.__init__ at 0x102f9cf40> is a "magic method".
```

While this "magic method" is indistinguishable from a technology sufficiently advanced, we have bothered to program some other stuff.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML) and [here](https://github.com/Cave-Dwellers-Tree-People/minihydra), and maybe [here](https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries) and [here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy), and maybe [here](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs) and [here](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam), ***with more to come***.

**If this seems evil**, which it totally is, it's because "pure-AGI" (A.K.A. Skynet) is perhaps overkill as the singular solution for all of humanity's problems — like splitting an atom in order to power a solar battery. We've (un-)subtly acronym'd AGI as "A General Intelligence", referring to people. Artificial/Robot-General-Intelligence is a good motivating objective to programmers like me who have to do the work, because it's cool and has potential good implications, used wisely. But, in all sincerity — can be useful and necessary in understanding the nature of consciousness, neuroscience, and in providing a framework for formalizing the "general intelligence" of theological views and God.

# Principles

## An idealistic vision that includes doable specifics

here are 4 concrete and as of 2024 novel ideas for using AI for the welfare and benefit of humanity:

**Imagine** catching fish with line, hook, and lure attached to autonomous drones, bringing back yields.

**Imagine** solar hubs intelligently flying to better locations of more light, bringing back unlimited power for the community, across varied weather conditions.

**Imagine** autonomous irrigation systems that can deliver clean water to the global poor, automatically across vast distances, powered by solar renewable self-sustaining technologies.

**Imagine** distribution (not detonation) drones that can deliver food and solar technologies to war zones safely to help civillians, promote communication, and bring about peace.

## Sustainable abundance and distribution

See above: solar-powered fishing drones. Additionally, low-energy airships kept afloat by helium, with tanks for storing the fish, to bring back the yields of healthy, wild-caught fish to hungry communities. Above the clouds abundant sunlight is available for solar powered, self-sustaining deliveries, via the energy-conservative helium-based vessels.

The quantity of fish obtained through this autonomous self-sustaining method should be sufficient to at least feed healthy-food supplies to coastal villages in globally-poor regions, if not for industrial purposes.

## Express opposition of AI uses for military and surveillance

We will always put humanity, nature, and Mother Earth first, ahead in the queue before money, bottom line, propriety, or even the art itself.

Everything from de-centralized food production to de-centralized energy is possible with intelligence, but that level of abundance comes paired with human shortsightedness. Wisdom is paramount: towards humanity's understanding of deeper learning and deeper intelligence… the highest of which being processes of relational healing. And seedening humanity’s respect for the intelligences, wisdoms, and magics of nature.

Our principles are rooted in nature, reason, and healthy idealism. Supporting us allows us to keep providing open-source distributions of our technologies. Thank you for your support. More info inside the [Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/AGI-init) button.

# Goal

**Ending world hunger** and ending healthy-food shortages - autonomous fishing drones with line, hook, and lure, powered by self-sustaining solar technologies thanks to abundance of sunlight and independence from weather conditions of high-altitude.

- Together with the fisherman-drones, helium airships with tanks inside to store the fish and deliver back yields of healthy, wild-caught fish. Sustainabilty practices must still apply, even with fishing automated. A limit can also be put on how many generations these wild-caught fish can be farmed as well after being caught, so as to balance abundance with permaculture.

**Implementable through:** simple neural network behavior cloning / imitation learning / demonstration learning fine-tuned and aligned on top of a foundation temporal-vision model with a fleet of many fisherman-drones in parallel to initially collect data and execute curriculums. Training in entirety only has to happen once and then wild-caught, fresh fish becomes free and abundantly available (assuming sustainability practices) for our generation and all future generations for the rest of time.

- Doable in less than a year with today's technology and some funding pretty easily.
  
# Recap of principles

On a broader level:

- *Humanity before mechanization*
- *Heart before calloused mind*
- *The earth and sky, mountains and brooks, fauna and flora, before industrialization*

Politically:

- *Environmentalism*
- *Democratization*
- *Equity*

And going a step further:

- *Anti-militarism*
- *Anti-surveillance*

I am an environmentalist, tree-hugger, and probably crazy shamanic priest. Please [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/AGI-init) to support and I will do right by you and nature, who governs and nourishes transcendent to the whims of profit and art.
