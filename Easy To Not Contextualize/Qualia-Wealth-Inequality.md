The qualia wealth inequality is too high! Just look at how much Saagar enjoys VR! Consciousness puzzle, when you have more, you need less. When you have less, you need more. I would say “it’s not quali, it’s conqciousneaa” but my phone literally just threw a panic attack. Ah I should add “qualia without fear” or “consciousness without fear.” Or “consciousness intensity/absorption/consumption without fear.”

But Krystal is right, that is not the goal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZc6aO1MwYU

VR takes us out of real consciousness, but gives us more consciousness/qualia than real life does.

That's not the goal though, we are looking to fully be present in consciousness in real life, with metaphorical grass available to all, such that the VR experience/qualia/quality doesn't even feel like more.

I'm just summarizing in my language.
