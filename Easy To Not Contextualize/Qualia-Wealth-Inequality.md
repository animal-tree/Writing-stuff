# VR and consciousness 

The qualia wealth inequality is too high! Just look at how much Saagar enjoys VR! Consciousness puzzle, when you have more, you need less. When you have less, you need more. I would say “it’s not quali, it’s conqciousneaa” but my phone literally just threw a panic attack. Ah I should add “qualia without fear” or “consciousness without fear.” Or “consciousness intensity/absorption/consumption without fear.”

But Krystal is right, that is not the goal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZc6aO1MwYU

In my normal-person language:

1. VR takes us out of real consciousness, but gives us more consciousness/qualia than real life does.
2. That's not the goal though, we are looking to fully be present in consciousness in real life, with metaphorical grass available to all, such that the VR experience/qualia/quality doesn't even feel like more.

The only reason I'm posting this is because it makes me feel like I interpret the cryptic languages between languages and articulate them very literally and maybe somewhat less ambiguously, though probably not. "I know" something basically. ("It does!" I can hear the cryptic God minds say)

and the hopes of being on the show
