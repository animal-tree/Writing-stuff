Bad things happening doesn’t mean there isn’t a singularization above the division. Like your neurons, the brain of the universe can be divided and one. Like apoptosis, the universe can kill, for example. But when the neurons are so sophisticated that they develop their own wants and agendas, that's when conflicts of a higher singularized intelligence can emerge, even within a single brain. Disease sometimes, 

But even with the same wants and agendas, different paths can be debated or fought over and my brain is literally torturing me right now. Please God let me stop writing.

That was more true in linguistic sense than brain sense.
