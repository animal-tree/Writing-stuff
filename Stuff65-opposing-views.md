# Opposing views

## Philosophical

The evidence, for why my previous views [about synchronicities and the consciousness-tethering forces that regulate our minds] are wrong, is above-all the alternate explanation that they were **coincidences** and **confusion**. The best evidence for **coincidence** is:

1. Others' beliefs on those same coincidences just being coincidences.
2. Huge disruption/challenge to pre-existing, long-held beliefs, especially in physics.
3. Being a "prophet" in a population of 8 billion people, or, alternatively, some kind of spiritual government that is corrupt or highly unjust, are both unlikely.
4. The demand of work and time involved.
5. My relationships and status among other people being threatening or low.
6. The lack of non-minimal support, aside from my mom.

The **confusion** however is understandable given the many, in my opinion convincing, coincidences. Those don't need reiteration, though perhaps some need to be stressed more if I were to share this.

### Contextual defense of me, juxtaposed next to these ideas

The views that were held previously, and any associated mentalities or biases that one might perceive to be controversial, were not shared at work, because I understood how they could be perceived. My work for Chenliang and during my PhD was consistently really good. Any contentious views I shared on this GitHub didn’t in any way affect the quality of the work that I did under Chenliang and during my PhD at the university, which can be found chronicled at my other GitHubs [here](https://github.com/slerman12) and [here](https://github.com/agi-init).  

The consciousness severities that occurred, such as my first manic episode and the onset of catatonia, occurred after that hair loss that Strong Hospital caused through medical malpractice. I don’t think those consciousness severities would have affected me so severely, or happened at all, had I not suffered the loss of all my hair first due to treatment handling mis-practices around my eczema. 

## People

The opposing view in defense of my university-hospital doctor is, she might have had something else going on, or was too busy. Later, she took pictures of the hair loss with her nurse and diagnosed it honestly as alopecia universalis due to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. The opposing view in defense of my university-provided health insurance company Aetna is, they maybe didn’t notice that I had already been on the drug for a long time (I don’t remember the exact duration but between 6 months and 1 year) and wanted to save money. In defense of the university intermediaries who were in charge of providing and delivering the drug on a recurring schedule, they couldn’t contact the doctor and the doctor might have been on vacation or any other reason she might not have been reachable at the time; and, as mentioned, she was honest in directly diagnosing the rapid loss of my hair to the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. 

In defense of Chenliang: he eventually accepted me into his lab after Henry left, pressured me into writing a paper sooner, and stayed generally nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my social anxiety. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI. His spirit, in my confusion-views, promised me many things. He contradictorily seemed to respect my slower publication pace while I built UnifiedML, and I believed he "knew." Also, 2 publications in 3 years is (I think) less than his average student.

Michael, bumped my grade up in undergrad. Wasn't judgemental, sent many "talk?" emails, sort of kind of; one "talk?" email, one previous invitation to meet, but also no reply to my acceptance to meet; and mentioned the possibility of reinstatement at the end. He patiently waited and tolerated my incessant emails as I tried to defend myself, but ultimately took the word of the committee members. In defense of them, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met previously, and one of them mis-remembered the short 30-minute Zoom meeting that the four of us had as being 1.5 hours and twice. It was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members can recall. It was scheduled for 30 minutes: 20 minutes reserved for my presentation and the last 10 minutes for their independent-room discussion and final remarks. In defense of them, I did drop the line early after their final remarks, according to Chenliang, but I did a "bless you" sign with my hands that they didn't see and I thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, which I did. (This is sincere, but it's the least believable part. Note also: my previous committee members had not been available for reasons that had nothing to do with me). Independent to that meeting, and prior to any confrontations, Chenliang stated that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to not enough papers.

This concludes the opposing views portion with suicide.
