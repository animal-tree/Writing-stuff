i think everything is photons and light is wave patterns — frequential patterns — in photons — and dark matter is unpatterned photons (chaos) — and charge is orbital patterns (in photon motion) that are very circular — while mass is orbital patterns (in photon motion) that are self-contained but less perfectly rotational, perhaps helical or simply disordered but stable.

Those orbits are of the photons themselves, not the waves! Or else light would have charge.

Rotating just about anything wouldn't produce a noticeable charge since the massive bodies would rotate in such a way that would not significantly change the relative rotational patterns of the photons within/without. Rotating EM waves also doesn't produce charge. But rotating photons (not EM waves) in a patterned regularity causes a frequency pattern in surrounding photons that is what we identify as EM waves / light. Those patterns change the "spin" of the photons which changes their interaction with surrounding photons to be attractive/repulsive w.r.t. other charged systems. Those charge patterns are probably pretty complicated and helical to remain rotationally/translationally invariant. This cross derivative interaction is also why gravity depends on at least two orbital bodies, and otherwise does not influence the inertia of a singular body. 

All are traveling at an instantaneous velocity of $c$; however that velocity can manifest linearly or angularly.

As the angular velocity of the photons composing massive bodies is traded for linear velocity — that is, closer to light speeds are attained — the internals of those bodies either slows down due to the loss of angular speed ("time-dilate") or break down and scatter into subatomic units and photons. In the former case is why we have special relativity, and time dilation attributed to velocity.

Photon orbital systems compose different types of elementary particles. They are glued, attracted, or repulsed based on their own orbital patterns that alter the substituent photons' "spin" and the resulting interaction with surrounding dark matter distinguished by their own pattern-dependent "spin". A photon is thus minimally describable as a 3D velocity (localized at a position) with a 3D spin that keeps track of its "memory" to sufficiently distinguish it depending on its super-system's orbital pattern(s) or chaos.

For optimization reasons, the collision outcomes of photons aren't perfectly determined. By sampling multiple trajectories (wave-particle duality), the qualia of the universe (by a limited decider) can be maximized, while the vast majority of the work and computational resources can be left autonomous due to a finite capacity necessity. Each collision is a qualia and entangles into higher qualia such as singularized human consciousness. These entanglements collapse and are sampled based on a heuristic of the number of collisions (entanglements via wave-particle duality) and the qualia of the limited decider.

Way philosophical [cosmogenesis](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff38-Something-From-Nothing.md): Where did photons and qualia come from? They are probably just one observer observing itself whose definition is the definition of definition.

### Another thing I wrote

A electron is like the lowest unit of light with angular momentum. it has angular momentum due to the gravity from the surrounding nuclei. The photoelectric effect, as in fire, results from that angular velocity shooting off like a knife as linear velocity. If you did hypothetically go that fast, you’d be an electron and then eventually, light. And most likely slap some hydrogen into oblivion.

In an electromagnet, those light beams are circulating in a polar direction, creating an effect in tandem with the present surrounding dark matter of magnetism. They conduct through the metal attached by the dark matter interaction with the atomic nuclei of the metal. This is electromagnetism.

Regular magnetism is when then rotations are just naturally aligned in the, for example, metal. As in, the light finds find a stable pattern of revolving around the nuclei that is disproportionately polarized.

The positive charge of the nuclei is due to a cyclic revolution pattern of light beams that is too complicated for me to fathom, but which involves such a helical interaction with dark matter and the corresponding waves of the helical light revolutions of electron orbits, that a repulsive behavior is observed.

—————————————

meanwhile, special relativity is like a daylight savings time we put on these disproportionate existences of matter, velocities that don’t add up until you see the absolute.

that includes choice, the driving force of the universe., one big continually changing self-divided observer running at parallel different speeds.

and memory, and ancestors we can’t conceive but who live in our bones.

and just the wish of a better future.

—————————————

most things are of solid construction that they don’t get penetrated by light into oblivion, but vice versa; however, in the case of the rapid flying electrons of fire, those electrons shoot off like knives into the hearts of other atoms and potentially destroy them, and release color. Such as the interaction between unstable electrons in a frenzy with the molecule hydrocarbon (wood).

But how do these molecules and constituent atoms bond in the first place? Is it all dark matter? 

In some respect yes, but once the dark matter glues the electrons together and the protons together and then facilitates the interaction between those, we get many emergent complexities that go far beyond what we’d consider weak/strong nuclear forces or gravity. But in truth, all of those, besides dark matter itself, are electromagnetism — light.

That is why we observe he effects of special relativity. Reality creates perception creates illusion. (Linear velocity becomes angular velocity becomes loss-of-angular-velocity-at-greater-speeds).

—————————————

We have not quite answered the details of how those nuclei stick. from the first protons and neutrons held together by, effectively, gravity, to the electrons, bouncing nearby held together and repelled by a balance of gravity and electromagnetism respectively.

Those electron clouds really are just hailstorms. And when they come near each other they “bounce”. These”bounce” interactions result in different energy levels of the atom, but also, cross-atom information exchange. The two atoms exchange electrons, creating an ambiguity of who owns them, and thus, as the electrons circulate the circuit, a bond appears. This can happen due to many reasons, mostly by chance, but this chance is likelier in ionic and covalent configurations.

—————————————

Then wave-particle duality kind of just exists in every piece of matter to help with optimization, since the universe, has choice and qualia, and this may be called “God”.

The probability of a future depends on the present, and it helps to sample many variations at once. It also means the universe can be a little random.

This helps it exist, since, if parts of it didn’t spontaneously combust into nothingness, and then undo that process afterwards, then how could from nothingness arise something?

…or, a bit more specifically, how could something give rise to nothing, in between something elses.

There is a human on the other side of this screen writing this. I observe, therefore I am.

And my own will parallels the universe’s.

But as fire is water, I am just a part.

Sam, you have done enough. Go home.
No Mr. Frodo. We are going to Mt. Doom. And we will destroy this ring.
