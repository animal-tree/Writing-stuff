## (time-clock version)

$$\hat{t} = T(x^{(i)}, t^{(i)}, v^{(i, N)})$$

$\forall i < N$ and $i, N \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Definitions

$T$: The Lorentz transformation time equation: transforms the time of one coordinate system to that of another.

$v^{(i,j)}$: The velocity of coordinate system $j$ in coordinate system $i$.

$\hat{t}$: The time on coordinate system $N$ that the position-origin of coordinate system $N$ intersects the position of the exact center of the relay station hoop.

$x^{(i)}$: The unknown position of the exact center of the relay station hoop in coordinate system $i$, at time $t^{(i)}$ in coordinate system $i$.

$t^{(i)}$: The unknown time in coordinate system $i$ that is transformed to $\hat{t}$ in coordinate system $N$ via the Lorentz transformation time equation.

### Postulate and/or physical measurement

**Absoluteness of time and location identity postulate:** The time relative to itself at which a body undergoes an intersection with any given location has one and only one value, and physically exists.

Therefore $\hat{t}$ physically exists, whether measured, measured accurately/inaccurately, or not measured.

Quantum physics considerations can be accounted for via the below mechanism of physical measurement, with perhaps some approximation error in the actual numerical measurement. One could debate whether or not the wave function truly collapsed "100%" in that case.

The body can also be constrained to be non-quantum.

**Alternatively, physical measurement:** A rocket ship, positioned at the origin of coordinate system $N$, crosses through the exact center of the relay station hoop, where the inner edges of the relay station hoop shoot photons (or electrons) inward. $\hat{t}$ can at least approximately be measured by detecting the incoming rays on a sensor of a light clock aboard that causes the light clock to stop counting, thereby yielding a measurement, or of a second light clock aboard that causes the second light clock to start counting, thereby allowing for the calculation of a measurement via subtraction. Either way, this act of measuring collapses the wave function, arguably accounting for any quantum physics considerations in the earlier postulate.

> That being said, sufficient measurement accuracy can be obtained via this mechanism, by using it twice as follows: measure once via this mechanism at the initial position, perhaps incurring some measurement delay and approximation error; and then measure again via an identical mechanism at the relay station hoop. One starts at the beginning; one starts at the end; subtract the two to get the total time spanned, each accounting for the other's measurement delay and approximation error, assuming negligible randomness. An argument could be made about the two light clocks being adjacent rather than fixed in the same position; however, the two hoops (the initiating one at the start and the relay station hoop at the end) can account for this by respectively shooting photons (or electrons) from adjacent halves of the inner edge.

> If that is still yet unconvincing, consider the physical coordinate systems of Einstein: physical measuring rods and clocks. Somehow, a spacetime origin has to be defined for such a coordinate system to exist, yes? In order to do that, a mechanism is already implicitly assumed that synchronizes the two. Whatever that mechanism is, let that mechanism be this mechanism. Alternatively, let this mechanism be that mechanism, provided here for the future use of theoreticians.

> In any case, $\hat{t}$ measurably exists up to some extremely small precision error, and that measurement, once having collapsed the wave function, should not by any known law negate the reality of $\hat{t}$'s existence, as being in a coherent quantum state and existing, though perhaps uncertain in the highest absolute precision to the microscopes and branding irons of measurement (which, frankly, is always the case).

### Formal contradiction

Assume the Lorentz transformation equations hold between coordinate systems.

$$x^{(j)} = X(x^{(i)}, t^{(i)}, v^{(i, j)}) = \frac{x^{(i)} - v^{(i,j)}t^{(i)}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{{v^{(i, j)}}^2}{c^2}}}$$

$$t^{(j)} = T(x^{(i)}, t^{(i)}, v^{(i, j)}) = \frac{t^{(i)} - \frac{v^{(i,j)}x^{(i)}}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{{v^{(i,j)}}^2}{c^2}}}$$

$\forall i,j \in \mathbb{N}$.

(Appending to **Definitions** <br>$X$: The Lorentz transformation position equation: transforms the position of one coordinate system to that of another).

Let $N = 3$.

Let coordinate system 1 and the relay station hoop be stationary relative to one another. All coordinate systems are inertial, meaning their velocities stay the same. Therefore, we have $x^{(1)}$ as a constant and it is known.

Let $x^{(1)} = 1$.

(Appending to **Definitions** <br>*Relay station hoop*: just a hoop whose exact center is located at position 1 in coordinate system 1 and is stationary relative to coordinate system 1).

Since none of the coordinate systems are assumed to be simultaneous in time and they are each inertial, neither relativity of simultaneity nor acceleration enter the picture, these being the usual resolutions to special/general relativity and Lorentz transformation paradoxes.
