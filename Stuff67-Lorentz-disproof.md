$$\hat{t} = T(x^{(i)}, t^{(i)}, v^{(i, N)})$$

$\forall i < N$ and $i, N \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Definitions

$T$: The Lorentz transformation time equation: transforms the time of one coordinate system to that of another.

$v^{(i,j)}$: The velocity of coordinate system $j$ in coordinate system $i$.

$\hat{t}$: The time on coordinate system $N$ that the position-origin of coordinate system $N$ intersects the position of the exact center of the relay station hoop.

$x^{(i)}$: The unknown position of the exact center of the relay station hoop in coordinate system $i$, at time $t^{(i)}$ in coordinate system $i$.

$t^{(i)}$: The unknown time in coordinate system $i$ that is transformed to $\hat{t}$ in coordinate system $N$ via the Lorentz transformation time equation.

### Postulate *OR* physical measurement

**Absoluteness of time and location identity postulate:** The time relative to itself at which a body undergoes an intersection with any given location has one and only one value, and physically exists.

Therefore $\hat{t}$ physically exists, whether measured, measured accurately/inaccurately, or not measured.

Quantum physics considerations can be accounted for together with the below mechanism of physical measurement, with perhaps some approximation error in the actual numerical measurement. One could debate whether or not the wave function truly collapsed "100%" in that case.

The body can also be constrained to be non-quantum.

**Alternatively, physical measurement:** A rocket ship, positioned at the origin of coordinate system $N$, crosses through the exact center of the relay station hoop, where the inner edges of the relay station hoop shoot photons or electrons inward. $\hat{t}$ can at least approximately be measured by detecting the incoming rays on a sensor of a light clock aboard that causes it to stop counting, or of a second light clock aboard that causes the second light clock to start counting. Either way, this act of measuring collapses the wave function, arguably accounting for any quantum physics considerations in the earlier postulate. 

### Formal contradiction

Assume the Lorentz transformation equations hold between coordinate systems.

Let $N = 3$.

Let coordinate system 1 and the relay station hoop be stationary relative to one another. All coordinate systems are inertial, meaning their velocities stay the same. Therefore, we have $x^{(1)}$ as a constant and it is known.

Since none of the coordinate systems are assumed to be simultaneous in time and they are each inertial, neither relativity of simultaneity nor acceleration enter the picture, these being the usual resolutions to special/general relativity and Lorentz transformation paradoxes.
