We present a quantum theory compatible with special relativity:

1. All things move at the same speed.
2. Angular velocity creates varying linear velocity.
3. These angular/linear tradeoffs yield special relativity, as clock internals slow down with faster linear speeds.
4. These quantum-level interactions between orbiting and non-orbiting quanta create gravity and/or electromagnetism.
5. Perfect and aligned rotations create charge, imperfect/unaligned rotations just create mass.
6. Gravity is pressure gradients in chaos, electromagnetism is frequency patterns in chaos.
7. Chaos and all of these quantum "things" are dark matter, defined at least by a 3-dimensional velocity and a 3-dimensional spin to keep track of orbital pattern.

Goal: Simulate this with a differentiable physics universe to show emergent gravity, and directly derive that special relativity can emerge from this absolute formulation of linear and angular velocity tradeoffs creating relative time.

A simple rule between any two-pair of quanta based on their relative velocities and spins should suffice to produce the effects of gravity and electromagnetism, mass and charge. Different emergent orbital and helical patterns may be regarded as "elementary" particles.

All quanta are the same thing and interact with each other in the same way. However, for simulation purposes, it might be beneficial to divide into dark matter and light matter, since fewer particles would be needed to simulate a local-classical description of gravity. Otherwise, multiple particles orbiting one another are needed to become distinguished from surrounding ones.

Later, collisions can be extended to create waves of changing velocities, which get truncated based on number of subsequent interactions, to facilitate long-term non-local trajectory differentiability. A.K.A. wave-particle duality and entanglement, as observed in double-slit experiments.

We will use this as a precursor to generally draw the singularizing process of qualia and consciousness.
