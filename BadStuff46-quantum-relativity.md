We present a quantum theory compatible with special relativity:

1. All things move at the same speed.
2. Angular velocity creates varying linear velocity.
3. These angular/linear tradeoffs yield special relativity, as clock internals slow down with faster linear speeds.
4. These quantum-level interactions between orbiting and non-orbiting quanta create gravity and/or electromagnetism.
5. Perfect and aligned rotations create charge, imperfect/unaligned rotations just create mass.
6. Gravity is pressure gradients in chaos, electromagnetism is frequency patterns in chaos.
7. Chaos and all of these quantum "things" are dark matter, defined at least by a 3-dimensional velocity and a 3-dimensional spin to keep track of orbital pattern.

Goal: Simulate this with a differentiable physics universe to show emergent gravity, and directly derive that special relativity can emerge from this absolute formulation of linear and angular velocity tradeoffs creating relative time.
