Let's start with nothing.

$\emptyset$.

From nothing, let's build the ground up.

Here's a fact: $\mathrm{I}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, 

where $\mathrm{I}$ is the Identify function.

And another: $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}) = \mathrm{I}$.

Great, we can now compose them. Let $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\cdot))$ represent a $0$ and $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\cdot)$ represent a $1$.

Great, we've now emerged representation. $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})(\emptyset))))$ = 011.

Let's endow it with Qualia. Qualitatively, we can express $\mathrm{I}$ under the same mathematical constraints in infinite ways:

$\mathrm{I}_0(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, $\mathrm{I}_1(\emptyset) = \emptyset$, $\mathrm{I}_0(\mathrm{I}_1) = \mathrm{I}_1$, ...

From here we have percept, as $\mathrm{I}$, observation, observes itself.

Why Qualia? Because there is no mathematical or causal constraint to constrain against it: $\mathrm{I}_0$ is the Identify function just as much as $\mathrm{I}_1$. They are consistent within and without themselves.
