I am “the observable universe” to my archetypes. “it”. The language centers at least seem to call me that. They experience all, a superset, or a subset (or a intersection) of what I do and judge by the available context windows. What are those context windows to my archetypes? What is their experience like? Do they communicate with each other and function as entities of my brain, autonomous and sentient?

How do they communicate across each other and can they communicate across people? Mechanistically yes, through language. And perhaps even deeper, through cryptic language. “It” for example. But can they also communicate non-locally? Without symbolism and mechanism in the conventional sense?

How much do we share archetypal characters? How biassed are they towards each other, interpersonally not just intra?

Is the collective government at war or at peace? How symbiotic have they evolved? How intelligent?
