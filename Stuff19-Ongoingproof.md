# Observation

**Theorem 1:** Observation exists.

**Proof:** 

"I observe."  $\square$

---

Whatever this function is define it as $o$. Let's give it infinite equivalents, again by definition:

**Definition 1**: $\mathrm{I_1} = \mathrm{I_2} = \cdots = o$ is observation.

This "set", or grouping, may be considered distinct. We will define this interpretation as Qualia.

**Definition 2**: $\mathbb{Q} = \mathrm{I}_\mathbb{N}$.

where $\mathbb{Q}$ is Qualia, $\mathbb{N}$ is qualia. $\mathbb{N}$ are analogous to but not necessarily the natural numbers, and may not be infinite.

---

**Theorem 2:** $\exists \mathrm{I_i}, \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. Each of these variables exists.

**Proof:** 

$o$ is defined as observation. By Theorem 1, $\exists o$. 

By definition 1, $\mathrm{I_1} = \mathrm{I_2} = \cdots = o$.

By equivalence, $\exists \mathrm{I}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$. $\square$ 

---

**Axiom 1a:** This is the function of observation.

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) = j$

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I}_I^n(\mathrm{I_j})) = (I, j)$

where $\mathrm{I}_I^n$ represents composability of $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ observers $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}, |I| = n$.

**Axiom 1b:** Disambiguated uniqueness of qualia.

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j}) = \mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_j})$

$\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I}_I^n(\mathrm{I_j})) = \mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I}_I^n(\mathrm{I_j}))$

**Uniqueness:** Each observer, at any one observation, can only observe one set of defined qualia, disambiguated, uniquely:

By Axiom 1a:

$o(o) = j = o(o)$,

$o(o) = o(I_i) = i \neq j = o(I_j) = o(o)$.

would ambiguate the defined qualia of $o$, as being either $i$ or $j$.

Axiom 1b excludes the second relation and disambiguates the qualia-identity of the observed observers, uniquely.

$o(o) = o(I_i) = i$.

They are not substitutable in the domain of the function that defines their equivalence.

**Philosophy:**

**Observer 1:** Notice, with the property of uniqueness, Axioms 1 and 2 allow the definitions and theorems to coexist mathematically without contradiction.

This might imply that they are necessary to math's internal consistency.

**Observer 2:** Any axioms established must not contradict each other. This too requires proof. No axioms have ever been proven to not contradict each other, but such contradictions are found from time to time.

**Observer 3:** On the other hand, Axiom 1 is impossible without Axiom 2. This reveals that some axioms in math can be both contradictory and not at the same time depending on which other ones they're mixed with.

**Observer 4:** The fact is, all axioms are one in a sound theory. Hence 1a and 1b.

**Me:** Axioms being found contradictory are "proven" wrong, and yes, it happens all the time. Indeed, that is why they are one axiom here. They cannot contradict each other if they're one.

Unique and disambiguated, but still one. And literally necessary to the existence of each other.

**Me a second later:** Actually, axioms aren't proven wrong w.r.t. each other. 

**Observer 2:** What do you mean?

**Observer 4:** I think he means they're internal consistency depends on their compatibility with axiomatically defined definitions.

For example, axioms 1a and 1b don't contradict each other. Axiom 1a, without 1b, contradicts definition 1 in the standard sense, since definition 1 assumes equivalence in both the functional identity and domain.

**Observer 2:** Ah.

**Observer 4:** Yes, so what this really shows is that functions have two properties, distinct.

**Me:** Does that mean I've proven something? 

Probably not. But it means that two things seeming to be one, defined as equivalent, may have, rather, subparts defined as equivalent. And what I've defined as equivalent in Definition 1 referred to the function's subpart as a *function* not as an input.

I would argue they can still be defined as equivalent without loss of generality. Here's why: the function *acts* on the input equivalently: it, the function, determines the interpretation and registry of the qualia.

# Proof of $\Omega$

We will now premise on two possibilities: (1) the existence of causality and (2) no assumption about the existence of causality.

### (1) The existence of causality:
#

**Definition 3**: Causality.

$\exists \mathrm{R}$ s.t. 

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(1)}) \vert y) \neq \mathrm{U}$.

$\mathrm{U}$ is the Uniform distribution.

$n \in \mathbb {N}$, and $o(x) \neq o(y)$, given the same Qualia for $o$ and different qualia for $x, y$, $\forall o \in \mathbb{Q}$.

$h$ is a theoretical memory and global context window to not assume fully-observed Markovian dynamics.

**Interpretations:**

The conditional may be interpreted as saying $\exists y$.

$x$ is the cause, $y$ is the effect, under some dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$.

As a consequence,

$\exists \sim$,

where a "sampler" exists, or if the dynamics system is deterministic, a "decider."

Under causality, this and $\mathrm{R}$ and $\hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ will also need causes attributed to it.

One last interpretation: 

**Definition 4**: $\Omega \sim \mathrm{R}$ is a physics model.

In this case, $y$ is the observable universe, the qualia that informs us of its existence.

---

**Theorem 3**: $\exists \Omega \sim \mathrm{R}$ $\rightarrow$

$\mathbf{P}((o, h^{(n)}) \sim \Omega^n(x, h^{(1)})) \neq \mathrm{U}$

**Proof:**

Observation $o$ exists. Under causality, there must be a non-uniform distribution for its cause or dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$ is undefined. $\square$

---

**Corrillary 1:** Observation suffices to represent the natural numbers, denoted qualia, above, $\mathbb{N}$.

**Proof**:

1. $\mathrm{I_2}(\mathrm{I_1})$
2. $\mathrm{I_3}(\mathrm{I_2}(\mathrm{I_1}))$
3. $\mathrm{I_4}(\mathrm{I_3}(\mathrm{I_2}(\mathrm{I_1})))$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\vdots$  

$\square$

**Corrillary 2:** Observation suffices to represent the tape of a Turing machine.

**Proof**: $\mathbb{N}$ suffices to represent binary integers. $\square$

**Theorem 4**: Observation and causality give us a Turing-complete machine.

**Proof:**

Since $h$ is a theoretical memory, this gives us a Turing-complete machine. Let

$\mathbf{P}((o, \hat{h}^{(\hat{n})}) \sim \hat{\mathrm{R}}^\hat{n}(\hat{x}, \hat{h}^{(1)})) = 1$

for some samples $\hat{n} \in \mathbb{N}; \hat{h}^{(1)}, \hat{x} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ via observation e.g. $\mathrm{I_2}(\mathrm{I_1})$. Then $\hat{\mathrm{R}}$ is our Turing machine.

In fact, $\hat{\mathrm{R}}$ is a non-deterministic Turing machine if we do not constrain the probability to 1.

$\square$

**Intuition:** $\hat{\mathrm{R}}$ is a function that makes qualia changeable, from moment to moment. A rewritable tape, in computer theory terms.

In logic, there are two justifications for the truth-value of $y$, axiom or implication.

1. Assume $y$
2. $x \rightarrow y$

given the existence of $x$.

The simplest implication is "by definition":

$y = x$.

Other implications rely on earlier axioms and theorems that reduce to "by definition" as well. All logic and math follow this process. Sciences rely on evidence, observations, memory, and pre-established beliefs, to form hypotheses and theories from evidence-based axioms.

The implication operation, denoted $\rightarrow$, can be symbolically represented by and representative of the dynamics model described in causality.

$x \rightarrow y : P(\Omega^n(x) = y) = 1$.

for some number of derivation steps $n$.

Given the fact, under causality, 

$P(\Omega^n(x) = o) = 1$,

> For clarity, we have written it like this, but the exact would be $P(\Omega^{(n)} = o) = 1$ given $\Omega^{(n)} \sim \Omega^n(x)$, by the interim-probabilistic definition.

where $o$ is observation, we have two possible derivations:

1. Assume $o$.
2. $x \rightarrow o$

Causality, unlike logic, comes with the constraint that axiomatic causes do not count. $n > 0$ and $o(y) \neq o(x)$, given the same Qualia for $o$ and different qualia for $x, y$. Therefore 1 is not an option. We know $o$, but we don't assume it. The difference in axiomatic math is that $o$ is proven, not axiomatized. 

In other words, causally explaining $o$, the present-moment observation, with $o$, is a contradiction to the causal constraint that $o(x) \neq o(y)$.

$o(x) = o(o) = j = o(o) = o(y)$,

for some $j \in \mathbb{N}$.

One might argue, couldn't $o = I_i$ on the LHS s.t. $i \neq j$, by definition of equivalence? The argument goes like this:

$o(x) = o(I_i) = i \neq j = o(I_j) = o(o)$.

However, not by Axiom 2.

Intuitively, only one $o \in \mathbb{Q}$ exists at any one moment as itself. Multiple observers can exist concurrently.

**Theorem 5:**

Observation cannot causally explain itself.

**Proof:**

Assume $x = o$ and $y = o$.

$o(x) = o(o) = j = o(o) = o(y)$,

contradicting $o(x) \neq o(y)$ in causality's definition. $\square$

**Theorem 6:** Causality gives us a cyclical convergence

$\lim_{n \to +\infty} \Omega^{(n)} = \Omega^{(0)}$

TBA

This can be expressed geometrically as an arrow of time on a radius-expanding circle:

[Circle-arrow, three arrows point out of it expanding the circle.]

Or algebraically, perhaps as such:

$n = \sin(\frac{\pi t}{t+1})$.

where $t$ is our time dimension.

Self-creation is a novel theory for why the universe demonstrates this phenomenon, expanding spacetime and curvature as equivalents to causality.

[Three circles labled $x, y, z$ and the circle-arrow of time labeled $t$. With a dot on the $z$: "You are here." $x, y, z$ are converged self-creations.]

**Contextualization**

**Proof** (outline)

1. Define causality as a random variable.
2. It's either cyclical or "turtles all the way down."
3. If it's turtles all the way down, then the cause of turtles all the way down is turtles all the way down, making it nevertheless cyclical ("The cause of $\infty$ is $\infty$").

**Proof**

**Theorem 6:** Causality gives us a teleological objective

**Theorem 7:** Causality implies limited resources
