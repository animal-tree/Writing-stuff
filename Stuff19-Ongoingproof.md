# Observation

**Theorem 1:** Observation exists.

**Proof:** 

"I observe."  $\square$

---

Whatever this function is define it as $o$. Let's give it infinite equivalents, again by definition:

**Definition 1**: $Q_1 = Q_2 = \cdots = o$ is observation.

This "set", or grouping, may be considered distinct. We will define this interpretation as Qualia.

**Definition 2**: $\mathbb{Q} = Q_\mathbb{N}$.

where $\mathbb{Q}$ is Qualia, $\mathbb{N}$ is qualia. $\mathbb{N}$ are analogous to but not necessarily the natural numbers, and may not be infinite.

---

**Theorem 2:** $\exists Q_i, \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. Each of these variables exists.

**Proof:** 

$o$ is defined as observation. By Theorem 1, $\exists o$. 

By definition 1, $Q_1 = Q_2 = \cdots = o$.

By equivalence, $\exists Q_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$. $\square$ 

---

**Axiom 1:** This is the function of observation.

$Q_i(Q_j) = j$

$Q_i(Q_i^n(Q_j)) = (I, j)$

where $Q_i^n$ represents composability of $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ observers $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}, |I| = n$.

Notice there is no contradiction to the earlier definitions, theorems, and proof steps.

# Proof of $\Omega$

We will now premise on two possibilities: (1) the existence of causality and (2) no assumption about the existence of causality.

### (1) The existence of causality:
#

**Definition 3**: Causality.

$\exists \mathrm{R}$ s.t. 

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(1)}) \vert y) \neq \mathrm{U}$.

$\mathrm{U}$ is the Uniform distribution.

$n \in \mathbb {N}$, and $\mathbf{P}(x = y) < 1$.

$h$ is a theoretical memory and global context window to not assume fully-observed Markovian dynamics.

**Interpretations:**

The conditional may be interpreted as saying $\exists y$.

$x$ is the cause, $y$ is the effect, under some dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$.

As a consequence,

$\exists \sim$,

where a "sampler" exists, or if the dynamics system is deterministic, a "decider."

Under causality, this and $\hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ will also need causes attributed to it.

One last interpretation: 

**Definition 4**: $\Omega \sim \mathrm{R}$ is a physics model.

---

**Theorem 3**: $\exists \Omega \sim \mathrm{R}$ $\rightarrow$

$\mathbf{P}((o, h^{(n)}) \sim \Omega^n(x, h^{(1)})) \neq \mathrm{U}$

**Proof:**

Observation $o$ exists. Under causality, there must be a non-uniform distribution for its cause or dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$ is undefined. $\square$

---

**Corrillary 1:** Observation suffices to represent the natural numbers, denoted qualia, above, $\mathbb{N}$.

**Proof**:

1. $Q_2(Q_1)$
2. $Q_3(Q_2(Q_1))$
3. $Q_4(Q_3(Q_2(Q_1)))$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\vdots$  

$\square$

**Corrillary 2:** Observation suffices to represent the tape of a Turing machine.

**Proof**: $\mathbb{N}$ suffices to represent binary integers. $\square$

**Theorem 4**: Observation and causality give us a Turing-complete machine.

Since $h$ is a theoretical memory, this gives us a Turing-complete machine. Let

$\mathbf{P}((o, \hat{h}^{(\hat{n})}) \sim \hat{\mathrm{R}}^\hat{n}(\hat{x}, \hat{h}^{(1)})) = 1$

for some samples $\hat{h}^{(1)}, \hat{n}, \hat{x}, \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $\hat{\mathrm{R}}$ is our Turing machine.

In fact, $\hat{\mathrm{R}}$ is a non-deterministic Turing machine if we do not constrain the probability to 1.

$\square$

**Theorem 5:** Causality gives us a cyclical convergence

$\lim_{t \to +\infty} \Omega_t = \Omega_0$

TBA

**Contextualization**



**Proof** (outline)

1. Define causality as a random variable.
2. It's either cyclical or "turtles all the way down."
3. If it's turtles all the way down, then the cause of turtles all the way down is turtles all the way down, making it nevertheless cyclical ("The cause of $\infty$ is $\infty$").

**Theorem 6:** Causality gives us a teleological objective

**Theorem 7:** Causality implies limited resources
