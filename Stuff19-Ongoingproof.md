"I observe."

Whatever this function is define it as $\mathrm{I}$. Let's give it infinite equivalents, again by definition:

$\mathrm{I}_1 = \mathrm{I}_2 = \cdots$.
 
Each of these exists by definition.

Now apply these observers to each other. $\mathrm{I}_i(\mathrm{I}_j) = \mathrm{I}_j, \mathrm{I}_i(j) = j$.

Define this as Qualia.

---

Define the subscripts of Qualia as qualia and denote them $\mathbb{N}$.

We will now premise on two possibilities: (1) the existence of causality and (2) no assumption about the existence of causality.

The existence of causality:

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(1)}) \vert y) > 0$

$x$ is the cause, $y$ is the effect, under some dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$.

For every effect $y$, there is a cause $x$.

Then $\exists \hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ s.t.

$\mathbf{P}((o, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{\hat{R}}^n(x, h^{(1)})) > 0$

where $o = \mathrm{I}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is observation and $\hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ is a physics model.

Formally:

$\mathbf{P}((o, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{\hat{R}}^n(x, h^{(1)})) > 0$

Causality. $o = \mathrm{I}_{i \in \mathbb{N}},\mathrm{\hat{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$, h is theoretical memory, $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

This gives us a, Turing-complete machine.

**Theorem:** Causality gives us a Turing-complete machine. Proof above.

$\mathbb{N} \subset o = \mathrm{I}_\mathbb{N}$? Set theory doesn't have an answer to this.

Probability theory might.

$\mathbf{P}(B \vert E) = \frac{\mathbf{P}(E \vert B)\mathbf{P}(B)}{\mathbf{P}(E)}$

A number is a belief, by the human. Our evidence for it is the representational utility to describing consistencies in our world.

While such a belief might not be a "subset" of $o$, it can be represented by $o$. Take for example 

1. "0": &nbsp; $\mathrm{I_1}((\mathrm{I_2}(\cdot))$
2. "1": &nbsp; $\mathrm{I_1}(\mathrm{I_2})(\cdot)$

The two can be composed together:

3. "10": &nbsp; $\mathrm{I_1}(\mathrm{I_2})(\mathrm{I_1}((\mathrm{I_2}(\cdot)))$

**Theorem:** Causality gives us a cyclical convergence

$\lim_{t \to +\infty} \Omega_t = \Omega_0$

**Contextualization**

Before the proof, this equation deserves contextualization.
