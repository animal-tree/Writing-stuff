"I observe."

Whatever this function is define it as $\mathrm{I}$. Let's give it infinite equivalents, again by definition:

$\mathrm{I}_1 = \mathrm{I}_2 = \cdots$.
 
Each of these exists by definition.

Now apply these observers to each other. $\mathrm{I}_i(\mathrm{I}_j) = \mathrm{I}_j, \mathrm{I}_i(j) = j$.

**Define** this as Qualia.

**Define** the subscripts of Qualia as qualia and denote them $\mathbb{N}$.

We will now premise on two possibilities: (1) the existence of causality and (2) no assumption about the existence of causality.

(1) The existence of causality:

---

Assume causality.

**Definition**:

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(1)}) \vert y) > 0$

$x$ is the cause, $y$ is the effect, under some dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$.

For every effect $y$, there is a cause $x$.

Generally speaking,

1. $x \rightarrow y$
2. $y \leftrightarrow y, x=y$
3. $x=\text{Randomness}$

The arrow represents the application of recursive dynamics function $\mathrm{R}$ on the LHS $n$ times to obtain, at least in part, the RHS. The double arrow represents either the application of $\mathrm{R}$ $0$ times to obtain itself as definition/identity, or the application of $\mathrm{R}$ $n$ times to obtain itself by implication. The former is not considered a causal derivation, $n \neq 0$.

However, $\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(1)}) \vert y=\text{Randomness})$ would have to assume the existence of $\text{Randomness}$ as a variable under a mathematical derivation and definition not provided here as directly deducible from "I observe." 

**Definitions**: $o = \mathrm{I}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is observation, $\hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ is a physics model, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $h$ is theoretical memory.

**Theorem**: Then $\exists \hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ s.t.

$\mathbf{P}((o, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{\hat{R}}^n(x, h^{(1)})) > 0$

where $o = \mathrm{I}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is observation, $\hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ is a physics model, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $h$ is theoretical memory. $\square$

**Theorem**: Observation and causality give us a Turing-complete machine.

$\mathbf{P}((o, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{\hat{R}}^n(x, h^{(1)})) > 0$

1. "0": &nbsp; $\mathrm{I_1}((\mathrm{I_2}(\cdot))$
2. "1": &nbsp; $\mathrm{I_1}(\mathrm{I_2})(\cdot)$

The two can be composed together:

3. "10": &nbsp; $\mathrm{I_1}(\mathrm{I_2})(\mathrm{I_1}((\mathrm{I_2}(\cdot)))$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\vdots$

**Corrillary 1:** Observation suffices to represent the natural numbers, denoted qualia, above, $\mathbb{N}$.

**Corrillary 2:** Observation suffices to represent the tape of a Turing machine.

Since $h$ is a theoretical memory, this gives us a Turing-complete machine. $\square$

**Theorem:** Causality gives us a cyclical convergence

$\lim_{t \to +\infty} \Omega_t = \Omega_0$

Before the proof, this equation deserves contextualization.
