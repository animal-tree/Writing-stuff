"I observe."

Whatever this function is define it as $\mathrm{I}$. Let's give it infinite equivalents, again by definition:

$\mathrm{I}_1 = \mathrm{I}_2 = \cdots$.
 
Each of these exists by definition.

Now apply these observers to each other. $\mathrm{I}_i(\mathrm{I}_j) = \mathrm{I}_j, \mathrm{I}_i(j) = j$.

**Define** this as Qualia.

**Define** the subscripts of Qualia as qualia and denote them $\mathbb{N}$.

We will now premise on two possibilities: (1) the existence of causality and (2) no assumption about the existence of causality.

(1) The existence of causality:

---

Assume causality.

**Definition**:

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(1)}) \vert y) > 0$

$x$ is the cause, $y$ is the effect, under some dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$.

For every effect $y$, there is a cause $x$.

Generally speaking,

1. $x \rightarrow y$

The arrow represents the application of recursive dynamics function $\mathrm{R}$ on the LHS $n$ times to obtain, at least in part, the RHS. 

**Definitions**: $o = \mathrm{I}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is observation, $\hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ is a physics model, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $h$ is theoretical memory.

**Theorem**: Then $\exists \hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ s.t.

$\mathbf{P}((o, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{\hat{R}}^n(x, h^{(1)})) > 0$

where $o = \mathrm{I}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is observation, $\hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ is a physics model, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $h$ is theoretical memory. $\square$

**Theorem**: Observation and causality give us a Turing-complete machine.

$\mathbf{P}((o, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{\hat{R}}^n(x, h^{(1)})) > 0$

1. "0": &nbsp; $\mathrm{I_1}((\mathrm{I_2}(\cdot))$
2. "1": &nbsp; $\mathrm{I_1}(\mathrm{I_2})(\cdot)$

The two can be composed together:

3. "10": &nbsp; $\mathrm{I_1}(\mathrm{I_2})(\mathrm{I_1}((\mathrm{I_2}(\cdot)))$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\vdots$

**Corrillary 1:** Observation suffices to represent the natural numbers, denoted qualia, above, $\mathbb{N}$.

**Corrillary 2:** Observation suffices to represent the tape of a Turing machine.

Since $h$ is a theoretical memory, this gives us a Turing-complete machine. $\square$

**Theorem:** Causality gives us a cyclical convergence

$\lim_{t \to +\infty} \Omega_t = \Omega_0$

TBA

**Contextualization**

Before the proof, this equation deserves contextualization.

**Proof** (outline)

1. Define causality as a random variable.
2. It's either cyclical or "turtles all the way down."
3. If it's turtles all the way down, then the cause of turtles all the way down is turtles all the way down, making it nevertheless cyclical ("The cause of $\infty$ is $\infty$").
