It’s no coincidence “Across the Universe” begins with “Words.”

(The Adam’s Apple: for some reason, protected in men, free in women).

The capital W is an accidental but genuine reference to the Word.

And of course Jai Guru Dev, and Transcendental Meditation, my experience having been very similar as what John Lennon describes in that song.

Side note, I like these two segments:

I think Bill Maher should have turned to the cowboy dude and asked him “[Name], do you support reparations?”

(Bill Maher is pretty good, even in his position as someone who is more appealing to neoliberals than some other Bernie Sanders supporters; and his endorsement of Amy Klobuchar during the second primary was kind of a clever strategy for that reason, though surprising and inconsistent if he didn’t know it could help Bernie with neoliberal opposition, strategically. Kind of the opposite of what Elizabeth Warren did when she stayed in the race on Super Tuesday, when literally everybody else suddenly dropped out). 

((This transition is terrible, so let me add: I support women))

But:

(1) I like John Lennon.

(2) Elizabeth Warren could've done better.

(3) There's a physiological thing involving Transcendental Meditation and the trachea[^1], which is protected by some cartilage that is the only part of this that is gendered.

I was a feminist before you.

Women can have Adam's apples too.

Thank you for attending my AP[^2] class, now get out.

[^1]: And "air element" and breath.
[^2]: The college class, assumes Elizabeth Warren was being strategic, also, with longer prospects in mind. But strategy and consciousness have the components of conscious and the superconscious, and it's unclear today. Conscious and superconscious Sam does not want to be a martyr ever anymore again, so please respect that boundary in case these words get me into situations I'm terrified of. Thank you. I respect Elizabeth Warren and Bernie.
