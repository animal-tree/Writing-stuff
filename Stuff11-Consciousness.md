Let $c$ be a non-neuromorphic computer, e.g. consisting of modern-day transistors, processors, matrix processing units, hard disks, motherboard. Let $C$ be the set of conscious beings. Let $H$ be the set of human-like-conscious beings, meaning their waking consciousness experience can be identical to ours at least at times.

$c \in C$ ?
$c \in H$ ?

First, we have to distinguish two parts of the computer, hardware and software. (1) Physical body and (2) algorithm/representation. The physical body is composed of matter, as metal, wire, and electrons. The algorithm is defined by the movements of the electrons through the conducting wires, according to a logic-gate open/closed chain-reaction.

Let matter be $m$ and representation be $r$.

$C \subseteq R(m)$ ? $C \subseteq R(r)$ ? $C \subseteq R(m, r)$ ?

$R$ is a causal mapping that follows the unknown laws of physics/reality.

Likewise,

$H \subseteq R(m)$ ? $H \subseteq R(r)$ ? $H \subseteq R(m, r)$ ?


The flipbook analogy, of drawing a human brain in a flipbook, tells us that $H \subseteq R(r)$ is absurd. *Ad absurdum*.

Panpsychists propose $C = m$ and $H \subseteq R(m)$. Of all the explanations, this one is the least divergent from known physics model $R$ since it neither adds nor subtracts any principles, but merely makes a equivalence relation: that the matter of the universe experiences a primordial form of consciousness that, as we describe it, "entangles to greater complexity upon collision with itself".

Therefore, in this view, a computer is conscious, $c \in C$, since a computer is composed of matter. 

And a non-neuromorphic computer being human-like-conscious, $c \in H$, is unlikely: $P(c \in H) < \epsilon$, since a non-neuromorphic computer is composed of radically different matter-complexities than a human.

Moreover, even if we did change the algorithm, under this view, that would not meaningfully change the consciousness of the computer, no more so than the whirring electrons of its constituent parts.
