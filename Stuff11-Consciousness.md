Let $c$ be a non-neuromorphic computer, e.g. consisting of modern-day transistors, processors, matrix processing units, hard disks, motherboard. Let $C$ be the set of conscious beings. Let $H$ be the set of human-like-conscious beings, meaning their waking consciousness experience can be identical to our own at least at times.

$c \in C$ ?
$c \in H$ ?

First, we have to distinguish two parts of the computer, hardware and software. Physical body and algorithm/representation. The physical body is composed of matter, as metal, wire, and electrons. The algorithm is defined by the movements of the electrons through the conductive wires, according to a logic-gate open/closed (1/0) structure.

Let matter be m and representation be r.

$C \subseteq R(m)$ ? $C \subseteq R(r)$ ? $C \subseteq R(m, r)$ ?

$R$ is a causal mapping that follows the unknown laws of physics/reality.

Likewise,

$H \subseteq R(m)$ ? $H \subseteq R(r)$ ? $H \subseteq R(m, r)$ ?


The flipbook analogy, of drawing a human brain in a flipbook, tells us that H \subseteq R(r) is absurd. *Ad absurdum*.

Panpsychists propose $C = m$ and $H \subseteq R(m)$. Of all the explanations, this one is the least divergent from known physics model $R$ since it neither adds nor subtracts any principles, but merely makes a equivalence relation: that the matter of the universe experiences a primordial form of consciousness that, as we describe it, "entangles to greater complexity upon collision with itself".
