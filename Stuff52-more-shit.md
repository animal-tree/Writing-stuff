# Time Dilation Is Sufficient For Length Contraction

Suppose 2 Galilean reference frames $K, K'$.

Galilean assumes Galilean relativity, however, not Galilean-consistent measurements, necessarily. We will elaborate in a moment.

$K'$ is traveling at velocity $v$ relative to $K$ at a uniform motion with respective time origins intersecting with respective space origins.

At any given distance of the origin of $K'$ from the origin of $K$, $x$, an observer at the origin of $K$ measures time $t$.

However, due to a time-measurement dilation, at that same distance of $x$, an observer at the origin of $K'$ measures time $t'$. The time-measurement dilation is defined as follows:

$$t' = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

I am not sure if this makes sense, but the velocity of $K'$ can no longer be attributed to the same measuring units as any on $K'$.

This means that for $K'$ to describe any velocity, including its own $v$, a measuring unit conversion is needed.

What is that measuring unit conversion?

Well, a single step in distance at velocity $v=1$ does not correspond to a single step in time.

For this to be resolved, without assuming length contraction, we must invent a new $v'$ whose length units, also invented, call them $x'$ and describe them as a different-length measuring rod, must be defined.

So this $x'$, somehow, must correspond 1 step in $t'$ with one step in $x'$.

And from that a velocity $v'$ can be defined (as $\frac{x'}{t'}$).
