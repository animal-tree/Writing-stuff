Consciousness is collisions.

Consciousness is collisions in matter — elementary particles, atoms, boats, whatever you want to envision colliding. Each "bump" creates a "feeling" in space. 

Therefore as you read this, your computer — perhaps where you're reading it — is "feeling" the *whirring* of electrons. It's — probably — nothing like human consciousness, and in its current form never will be.

That's not to say it can't be. The open/close logic gates of a computer do parallel the biological activate-and-spike neuron. ("activate" is borrowing jargon from "AI").

However, its composoition of silicon and physical metals is *not* the same combo of bumps and giggle that your brain goes through, not the same hormonal explosions, or spinal zaps, or neurotransmitter ooglidoos.

Consciousness is collisions in everything. You are conscious because somehow those collisions "entangle". They do so locally, at least at the hierarchical level of it that we can be sure of — ourselves. That local entanglement in the fabric of physics and spacetime, is you. Its rich complexities are what define you. Its what distinguishes you from the algorithm that runs in whirring electrons of your computer's transisters and microchips.
