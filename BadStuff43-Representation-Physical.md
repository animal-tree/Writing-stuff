What makes something representational rather than physical?

Well, a representation is a physical property that refers to another physical property by analogy, via the interface of an interpreter: a human mind or any kind of reasoning system, such as, for another example, a computer compiler. The physical components require this interpreter to “translate” into the analogized meaning. For instance, the brain’s neural patterns — physically — are enzymes and grey matter and chemical signals and voltages. But by analogy they can represent everything that we perceive, think, and, at least to some degree, experience. Meanwhile, the electrons in a computer physically whirr through a circuit of logic gates, but those logic gates can represent everything expressible by a Turing machine grammar. Our language is sound waves, our poetry is multi-ambiguous translatable analogy, our scientific measurements even are holograms facilitated by communication mediums within/about the measuring devices. 

Thus, everything we read, scientifically measure via equipment, and *think* to a higher order, is representation.

Does that leave any room for physicality in the human experience?

It would seem not, if all of our senses are facilitated by neural representation. But this is where the theory of qualia appears. Not all things are represented. Presumably, somewhere beyond our sense perception is a physical world, whose properties are as described above. Presumably, we ourselves belong to such a physical world. And, possibly, some of our experience — though not always the parts we think — do too.

That experience cannot be produced through representation. If it could, a flipbook could be made conscious by drawing neural patterns in it. Since pen ink on paper is an absurd conception of a human-like consciousness, we can, for the time being, rule it out. Therefore, if consciousness is not purely representation, it must in some portion be physical.

Where in the physical universe these experiences occur could precisely correspond to our locations and our physical beings in physical spacetime, not as analogy. This is qualia, and it is a process of entanglement of the “lower-level” universe byte-code that physically IS — not represents — consciousness.

That lowest-level form is simply matter. So, what makes something physical rather than representational? Matter, yes. And by definition and consequence, qualia.
