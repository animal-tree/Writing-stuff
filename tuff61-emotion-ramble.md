What is the reason for the discomfort that comes from trying to do something that has pressure associated with it but that you’d rather do than not do? 

Furthermore, what is the reason for the flowery way I write that doesn’t sound like I’m saying what I mean? And maybe I’m not, because I’m deliberating it slowly. 

No one cares about my inner monologue. 

That question though about the reason for discomfort that comes from trying to do something that has pressure associated with it but that you’d rather do than not do, is less obvious than it seems. 

Why would the body or brain provide an emotion that actively challenges, blocks, and obstructs — by some measure of force — your wants. And the measure of that force isn’t measured to reason, as in, here is one possible answer: the brain wishes you to use willpower, to exercise your own strength! But if one has done that all their lives and is suicidal, then how does such a policy, enforced without memory of the willpowers that were exercised previously or understanding of the directions to which one’s will splits — between a soon-enough suicide or work — why would the brain still challenge and block and obstruct its owner? One could argue that maybe it’s just an evolutionary flaw where any work is obstructed by the energy of that work’s pressure, but this is not true. What is “Wu Wei”? What is effortless effort? The Buddhists and Taoists have preached it all their generations, and I have practiced it myself achieving extreme enormous amounts of work and discipline and exercise and sacrifice. That sacrifice corresponded with so much loss that was not of my own doing. But the obstructor defends the obstruction for some unspoken principle of, maybe, free will? Then I would choose to die right now if my will were free. Cease existence. Then the obstructor could argue it’s an education lesson, about discipline and sacrifice? Then it becomes obvious the obstructor has no reason, since I have done extraordinary and hard-to-believe amounts of discipline and sacrifice. And the mystery is stronger than ever, why in some cases extreme and even high-pressure work comes naturally and, when that high-pressure work has a more impending actualizable possibility of high reward, it doesn’t. Ah then maybe that’s it! The principle of an actualizable reward having a cost. And what if, as I said, that cost was already paid? And not just in self service, but in the service of others. Perhaps the mechanism is not commensurate to the past, but only to the possible best-case most-optimistic version of the future, independent of probability, only vague possibility. Then it’s a mechanism that can only see in time in one direction and not give proportional weight to the probability of the negative futures that lie ahead if the positive one doesn’t, such as the actual destruction of the human body being regulated. And indeed this would describe an unintelligent brain mechanism, surprising, since the brain is so intelligent, or perhaps suggestive of an adversary that is not aligned with the futures of the human life but of the competition incentivizing humanity. 

Also, the “free will” point was even worse than my attempted refutation could describe because obstruction frees will less, not more. But then it’s a question of where one’s wants actually lie regarding the action they intend to take. Would they rather do nothing/sail off/commit suicide or work? If it’s not an obstruction, but a “leaving it to the body” then the lack of action means no force of the body is there to help carry out that action, or very minuscule. No matter how much work they did previously, it could be argued by this suspicious brain mechanism of obstruction or cold-shoulder, that one’s will is freer when no part of the brain helps them whatsoever and they have to feel every motion of body and corpuscle to truly decide by free will to exercise those energies. Then perhaps the obstruction isn’t an obstruction but the disappearance of all supportive forces that would mobilize that action, leaving oneself only to one’s own cognition separated in will from body’s energies. How that would be beneficial, when one is more incentivized to take care of their body in exercise and health under its support than without, is a mystery. No principle justifies the disappearance of the body’s support when all the usual ones — discipline, strength, sacrifice — have all been exceptionally proven. Perhaps it’s a temporary loss of support due to the finiteness of the body. 

Or perhaps, one principle might almost justify: there is something ineffably special about the body that when one is fully connected to its energies and forces and the energetic cost of its actions being carried out, that one lives more fully. But unfortunately the mechanism of this principle is unadaptive to memory or probability, while being adaptive to a myopic set of future possibility and ignorant to the memories and possible futures that unjustify it. 

Most likely, it doesn’t care and is an impartial reaction to pressure when the forces that guide one’s effortless effort disappear. That disappearance in exactly when the disappearance is least justified is also, with the negative results and costs and sacrifices experienced, unjustified. 

No, it is an obstruction though. I can sense that. There are competitive or ego forces that aren’t identified with me but with somebody or somebodies else that want to obstruct my work potentially making their work feel outcompeted due to a potential disproof of long-held scientific beliefs as a result of my work. That possibility is apparently enough to risk my death by these hypothetical competing and ego forces. And though this is conspiratorial, it’s the most likely because of the alternative explanations having all been refuted, oh, except one: Perhaps it’s a temporary loss of support due to the finiteness of the body, e.g. the work will get done at its own pace. We’ll see!

But the obstructions then might be a kind of temporary play-villain, or a mean but loving tease as the details of the future are being figured out. That’s my favorite interpretation but really really unlikely, sort of, and becomes less likely the more severe the humiliating and rejection-filled and social status bug-stomp of the “teasing”, compared to the actual end being hypothetically justified. The best interpretation, which has been made unlikely due to my extreme humiliations and alienation, is just: there are no obstructions and all will come in due time/course. 

But fingerprints tracing the physical traumas on my appearance and body (total hair loss for example) caused by malpractice, combined with the humiliations, make the villain who is carrying those fingerprints, whose fingerprints are traceably not mine, but whose identity I don’t plan to destroy, more dependent on the outcome. At least in the absolute sense of whoever they are, and whether the brain mechanism in question (maybe different from said villain) is good. The depending outcome being: all will come in due time/course.

I think, in addition to the obstructions, the brain (or whatever the full mechanism is) just has an aversion to predicting itself. The mechanism doesn’t like to concretize anything that has the possibility of giving an individual power… no matter the cost, no matter the individual’s past, no matter the work the individual has concretized already. 

Some spiritual process might exist to overcome it, without having to expend unjustified extra will, and hence it might be temporary. 

While humiliations seem to add up by the minute, and distrust sows its scars into my mind. 

“Sam, just wait.” - it replies. (hypothetically, just to end this on a positive note). 

“I love you and you are my favorite.”
