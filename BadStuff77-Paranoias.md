Paranoias Along The Spiritual Mechanism Discovery Process

Some of these are paranoias, some of these are theories

1. Circles or “rhyming” - also tied to rehearsals - or cyclicality
2. “Emotions have regulatory processes that are not just out to help us.” - at least individually
3. Language can mind-control through cryptic semantics and even phonetics. 
4. Things aren’t planned, by a perfect and much wiser wisdom.
5. Grammatical structures to emotion regulation, that are out to help us. 
6. We have different goals, depending on the “archetype”, “individual”, and “God”.
7. We have different plans, depending on the “archetype”, “individual”, and “God”.
8. The crypticism is really stupid, like “sex stuff”.
9. The crypticism isn’t really intelligent, beyond limited awareness at any given moment, and connecting to not-points 6 and 7. Pork barrel.
11. Fear, fundamentally, is warranted. But of course this is true.
12. We are not divided.
13. Externally motivated disruption of perception
14. Purchases rather than rehearsals.
15. Evil, at the top of the top.
16. Language crypticism, where if I don’t say what they want me to, missteps or bad things will happen.
17. That my actions parallel the actions of others, and if I don’t respect the right symbolism, I will cause, by coincidence or effect, the misjudgment in the other person that leads them to act villainously, and that through by exact spiritual connection, indeed this is enforced, leading to, potentially, for example, my looking at a lightbulb causing the other “to see the light” or something benign synchronistically causing someone to treat you unjustly. “Shadowing” - you are role-playing as someone else, or someone/something else in your life is
18. That the same as 16 but God’s decisions, literal actual God — terrifying. Sincerely.
19. That consciousness will go away, I’ll mess up, and it won’t remediate.
20. That the high-shelf banter isn’t really high-shelf.
21. That people and things are placed by extreme symbolism. For example, neighbors representing the closest parts of ourselves, while living in a dirty neighborhood.
22. Context is a scary-effective consciousness regulator, where a change in context can suddenly mind control a person into acting alien to themselves and their own meaning. For example, the inclusion of titles in this document changing my linguistic style and thought process, as I write it.
23. That this context, especially its short-term changes, can’t be discerned from a long-term perspective by own consciousness regulators, whose functions regulate my linguistic style, what I’m aware of, [something was skipped], memory, understanding, physical appearance including attractiveness, health; and that this is a manipulation rather than a spiritual process with long-term-planned, and long-term point.  It might just be a context-destruction-averting process — but context should be the servant not the commander, so unless those emotions and contexts rapidly adapt and remediate, according to the best possible thing, then this is bad and terrifying.
24. Regarding the “[something was skipped]”, I don’t know and that, as well as pork barrel, scares me, especially since, the memory remembering and forgetting suddenly seems like it has no point. Why did I forget that? In the middle of writing. As the sentence unfolded. Without remembering again.
25. That it matters — but then why is the emotion telling me it does and gaslighting me to think it doesn’t? And these things obviously do matter.
26. That somehow my happiness or relaxation is doing me a disservice.
27. That whatever this is, is always seeking to betray. 
29. That I’m smarter than the "God"-force.
30. That there isn’t a way to law out of law, in the sense of, a hidden intelligence that ensures its plans, which are limited in their executability, are always met.
31. That there’s “more” or “less” or “the same” I need to do now, and consequences otherwise.
32. That the GOOD meaning I create in my head isn’t real, or at least the hopes that are associated with it won’t be realized.
33. That the bad psycho-spiritual and hypnogogic, e.g. transcendent, meaning I create in my head is real.
34. That the forces of those higher powers, are actually bad, etc. Re-treading
35. The brutal impact of rational hopes that arose spiritually destroyed/wasted/threatened.
36. [After some edits to the below] that my pleasure in any way harms me, hurts my case, or helps others against my will.
37. That minor faux pas are life sabotaging, due to symbolic happenings like sending a photo of myself with someone I absolutely actually loved in the context of photos of Chenliang and groups of PhD students, in the earlier message stream. Then the gaslighting in my brain that ensues for having tried to save a photo that meant a lot to me. A photo that makes me feel good, but due to the context, somehow suspiciously doesn’t anymore, like it’s roboticized. But that’s not fair because I know I value and cherish that memory, the feeling, and what I saw as real. I lost her to U of R, in a way, from one really bad interpretation.
38. Furthermore, that what I see can somehow sabotage me later, due to cryptic sabotaging dis-jokes.
39. That I, Sam, am somehow embodying someone I don’t like, e.g. Michael or Chenliang, and forced to act in accord with things that — that some terrible dread and fear will happen if I don’t do exactly as I need to.
40. That somehow I gave my pleasure to them, as if it’s an exchange, by refraining.
41. That these forces exist in my brain right now and don’t understand me, or are being influenced by it, and my actions at this very instant are paramount, like a remote-control, gaslighting me, mind-controlling me, and dependent on me, but use that power for nothing but misguided evil, caricature-like cliche, and rule-of-threes, requiring that. Stay charming even when, physically, I’m alone.
42. That watching a movie or paying attention to certain symbols can change my story, or hurt me due to some link between mental emotional state and synchronistic events occurring causally. Or even the prince of those symbols, crypticisms, etc., in story, myth, or so on, something that’s plausible.
43. The requirement of faith: that if I don’t obey certain feelings, especially ones I know are unpleasant but that tell me to do something without logic or reason other than “do it to show faith in the unpleasantness” or, scariest of all, “do it because there’s a cryptic grammar under which all things obey, and if you don’t — if you don’t hit the target of that faith — then you’ll miss.” And would not symbolism as a kind of programming on the human mind, or something God or some good is overly dependent on, with you as the messenger, be terrifying, due to the moral and systemic and relational responsibility, all involved in one system?
44. But isn’t it also just as unrewarding to find out something you wanted to have faith in, an arrow or target, might be less than important than previously thought? To discover an alternative that may or may not be better, creating anxiety about which-way paths would have been more fruitful and fulfilling, and better to the relational center that you are optimizing and loving? But wanting those precognitions and telepathies is natural because nobody wants to feel in charge, and people, or at least me I should say, want to feel subservient to something with a much wiser plan and far more power, due to aforementioned responsibility and risk of power without principles to base on — though faith, pleasant faith, might be entirely good synchronized with those rationalities. Unsynchronized, I suppose it should still be un-harmful on the plan of God. So how does one allay fear when there is fear, if chasing the unpleasantness in faith is not always the mandated responsibility, though it sometimes is? By acting in the manner of one’s principles towards the goal of that faith within comfort, or at least as much of it as can be summoned for a particular problem and situation. It’s disappointing though, if something doesn’t make us, unknowingly, through just sheer want, if instead it feels like a heroin needle towards the direction of more gambling-faith, throwing ones lots and meanwhile, selling one’s daughters, out of a fear disguised as the God. It’s fun though, last of all, to pretend — not that it’s pretend — that something will catch us if we do cast those dice into the pillow-beds of the universe, and that there is a system that we can rely on. But then, alas, it’s not faith, it’s the seeking of system to cheat the faith of rational comfort and want, to gain pleasure from the unknown of uncertainty, which is, itself, not always a bad thing, depending where you cast those lots. It’s scary how certain things will change our feelings, so that unpleasantness is really worrying — what we can and can’t do and how we literally well up with pain when things take a turn for the worse, to have our hopes crushed, to have our faiths crushed, and sometimes, by complete stupidity, by our own emotional reactions as the world’s temperaments progress. To have someone with us to process those pains with is extremely meaningful if we can find one who can bare to stand to us so close and with so much power and vulnerability put upon us, on our shoulders, hearts shared.
45. Another dimension that others live on, on which they interpret all the same things through a different perspective that comes to clash, and though all events seem to align from both perspectives, at a certain point they suddenly misalign or one turns out to be demonic, a demonic realm, where people — all people — actually live, and that their state of consciousness is tied to those realms, as pretenders in this one. But, unlike me, they know they’re lying, that the dimension they are pretending is not the one they’re in or that the dimension they are conveying they are in is not the one they know they are in, or, effectively, lizard-people. 
46. Somehow messages trigger radical consciousness changes. 
47. Somehow they also feel really, really wrong, for no rational reason. And no faith-based reason. 
48. Somehow I’m manipulated into self-sabotage or sabotage with others through these consciousness changes. 
49. The fear that this manipulation has no point. That some competition, something evil in the cryptic collective is artificially intervening in my literal brain and psyche. 
50. Somehow my language context radically changes with people, or depending on the people, like a character is playing me as I am somebody else, with different motivations and knowledge. 
51. Addictiveness of writing, as I seek a handshake from my words that is only met with more mush. Mush, swirl, soup.  - this one, summarizing/engendering many of the previous is one of my biggest mysteries of consciousness: what is this death-like lactating/spewing of my brain cells. Did I fail a language test? Did my phonetic hit the wrong phonetic?
52. Phonetics or linguistics have a required grammar, where if you overstep the wrong vowel, consonant, semantic, or crypticism, you “die” and the game starts over. Your consciousness goes to mush and you recycle. This makes no sense as a brain policy because it tends to result in streams of innocent messages that others block me for for no reason I can discern whatsoever. 
53. Are there hidden games between people, where subliminal purchases and transactions of consciousness are made?
54. Are people, including me, mind-robots, capable of gross misjudgment or, in my case, gross misrepresentation of myself via the words that my brain feeds me?
55. Are people shortsighted in their symbolic interpretations of minor crypticism? That is, do they read into superficial cryptic meanings as heavily as I have but now based on much lower-shelf base-level interpretations that, for example, analogize the word "wet"/“dry” in the context of Gideon and the fleece to some stupid sex or attraction kind of interpretation instead of as the Biblical meaning of whether the test succeeded or failed?
56. Are people sleeper-agents for one another, decoys ready to betray in the cryptic collective one’s trust to the cloud of conspirators?
58. There is very much evidence that peoples’ actions don’t align with the reward will of God. For example, people might try to manipulate the technology of synchronicity to convey wrongdoing where God has unequivocally and unambiguously conveyed that good action was taken. This actually isn’t paranoia-inducing, it’s a huge relief because of the enormous gaslighting that seems to come from the reward/punishment decisions of humans. So then, why doesn’t God make up for those inconsistencies in the gaslighting and the reality? Why does the gaslighting always seem stronger? Why is Gideon’s second fleece-attempt always seem to turn out wet? Are there enemies? This makes it sound like I believe in God and doesn't really convey what I mean - I think what I mean can be conveyed by this example: there's synchroncity evidence, if you believe in synchronicity, that God, if you believe in God, wanted Bernie Sanders to win the presidential election. That synchronicity evidence is (1) the bird that landed on his podium (in a crowded audience as he was waving his hands inches from him), (2) us being punished the first time with Trump (also unprecedented) the Republican-side populist who was attacked by a Bald Eagle on video around the same time as that bird landed on Bernie's podium, and (3) a lot of other unprecedented considerations the second time, including "Shadow", statistically unprecedented loss after winning at least popular vote of Iowa and New Hampshire and all of the betting markets betting on him a Jewish 78 year old Democratic Socialist who'd originally endorsed Elizabeth Warren to run, unprecedented Super Tuesday with Warren for some reason staying in as a probable spoiler when everyone else dropped out, and then us getting punished with Covid the second time which forced Biden to resdistribute wealth (a lot of poor people got their biggest paycheck ever) and cut people some work slack. So it seems like God doesn't exactly get a vote. It's also an ongoing farce in 2024 (between someone with dementia and someone being criminally prosecuted) where the absurdity calls into question whether this is really human action or if we're being satirized by actual-God.
60. That Karmic balances put a price on synchronicities, luck, and miracles
    1. For that matter, that those things only happen because something else — the far more precious thing — is traded, the relationship that was supposed to be that miraculousness
61. The sense that my writing isn't mine, and the fear that others don't realize that these linguistics are agents in and of themselves
62.
