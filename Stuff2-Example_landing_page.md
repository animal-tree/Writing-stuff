*Intelligence exists plainly in nature.*

Python has something called [magic methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/). One of these is the ```__init__``` method, which initalializes a class. See below:

```ruby
class AGI:
    """A General Intelligence"""

    def __init__(self):
        ...


print(f'{AGI.__init__} is a "magic method".')
```

> This "magic method" is indistinguishable from a technology sufficiently advanced.
>
> We will describe below what it is sufficiently advanced *for*.
>
> Namely, what this initiative, *AGI.\_\_init\_\_*, aims to bring about.

---

* Imagine drones, little drones, catching fish with line, hook, and lure, autonomously bringing back yields.

* Imagine autonomous irrigation systems that can deliver *clean water* to the global poor, automatically across vast distances, powered by solar renewable self-sustaining technologies.

* Imagine solar hubs intelligently flying to better locations of more light, bringing back unlimitted power for the community, across varied weather conditions.

* Imagine safety protocols so stringent that you could take a flyer or quadruped *hunting* and still not be able to use it to hurt, harm, or kill another human.

* Imagine forest-fire trackers and wildlife extinction surveillance technologies that *mathematically couldn't under any circumstance be used for human surveillance.*

* Imagine recommender systems that can advise you about social events and connect you innocently to others by recommending and even arranging events where your data cannot be accessed or used for advertising or exploitative purposes.

In our code, we strive for:

- *Minimalism*
- *Beauty*
- *Pedagogical clarity*
- *SOTA performance*

All 4.

On a broader level:

- *Humanity before mechanization*
- *Heart before calloused mind*
- *The earth and sky, mountains and brooks, fauna and flora, before industrialization*

Politically:

- *Environmentalism*
- *Democratization*
- *Equity*

And going a step further:

- *Anti-militarism*
- *Anti-surveillance*

The latter two are less frequently cited by other, leading institutions.

## Pledge

We will always put humanity, nature, and Mother Earth first, ahead in the queue before money, bottom line, propriety, or even the art itself.

The not-so-subtle reality here is that these technologies are not de facto safe for the world, and can be profited from in ways vastly different from how we just described and would like to imagine. The reality is all technology ever invented has had the potential to cause great evil and great good. The good often struggles to catch up, panting heavily behind the detonations and the drone strikes and the profitting. A great engineer morality *and* wisdom is needed for the future that, how ever, we are entering. If the vision above brings just as much horror into your heart as idealistic hope, it's because you know the same technology can be used to create far different futures than catching fish.

Everything from de-centralized food production to de-centralized travel to de-centralized internet is possible with intelligence, but that level of abundance comes paired with human shortsightedness that risks error in ways that are not plainly obvious until manifested and actualized. Wisdom is paramount: towards humanity's understanding of deeper intelligence and seedening humanity’s respect for the intelligences, wisdoms, and magics of nature.

I am an environmentalist, tree-hugger, and probably crazy shamanic priest. Please [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/AGI-init) to support and I will do right by you and nature, who governs and nourishes transcendent to the whims of profit and art.

## Counter-argument

**Worry**: Sam, the vision you painted is horrifying. I want my comforts as they are now, my routines, and for nothing in the world to dramatically change.

Me painting it has nothing to do with it happening. It can be brought about beautifully in a way that doesn’t disturb you or it can blindside us the way Covid did.

**Comfortable and wealthy, but intelligent engineer**: Sam, you’re an AI doomer. 

Not really. I think the beautiful version of events is more than possible. But businesses can sell weapons to the Department of Defense and collect data in ways that violate user trust. Meanwhile, governments can use those weapons to continue their endless wars (for the sake of obsolete energy technologies) and spy on people. None of this doomerism is radical since it’s provably already happening.

**Why your business?**

It’s not even a business. Right now I just have [good code](https://github.com/Cave-Dwellers-Tree-People/minihydra) and need [support](https://github.com/sponsors/AGI-init). 

Moreover, [UnifiedML](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML) is really good. Really good, and can absolutely be used for good (and evil) since I’m releasing it open-source. I want to have a say in the role of a technology I put out in the world, a technology that can be used to build the very things described above — in their best light.

**I DON'T WANT TO DE-CENTRALIZE THINGS!**

Someone will eventually sell an infinite hungry-people-feeding drone to a commune or two and you are welcome to continue paying for fish at the supermarket.


## One more thing

[Not to emulate Steve Jobs presenting the new Apple](https://youtu.be/x7qPAY9JqE4).

In the meantime, I'm building a differentiable intelligent physics model of the universe that I think can explain consciousness and revolutionize theological philosophy (as well as physics). So, [fund me](https://github.com/sponsors/Cave-Dwellers-Tree-People) if you are interested in that too.
