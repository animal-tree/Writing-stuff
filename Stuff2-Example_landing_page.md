*Intelligence exists plainly in nature. While we look for it in circuits and gadgets, it floats and sparks around us.*

Python has something called [magic methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/). One of these is the ```__init__``` method, which initalializes a class. See below:

```ruby
class AGI:
    """A General Intelligence"""

    def __init__(self):
        ...


print(f'{AGI.__init__} is a "magic method".')
```

Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic, and this is what AGI.\_\_init\_\_ aims to bring about.

* Imagine drones, little drones, catching fish with line, hook, and lure, autonomously bringing back yields.

* Imagine autonomous irrigation systems that can deliver *clean water* to the global poor, automatically across vast distances, powered by solar renewable self-sustaining technologies.

* Imagine solar hubs intelligently flying to better locations of more light, bringing back unlimitted power for the community, across varied weather conditions.

* Imagine safety protocols so stringent that you could take a flyer or quadruped *hunting* and still not be able to use it to hurt, harm, or kill another human.

* Imagine forest-fire trackers and wildlife extinction surveillance technologies that *mathematically couldn't under any circumstance be used for human surveillance.*

* Imagine recommender systems that can advise you about social events and connect you innocently to others by recommending and even arranging events where your data cannot be accessed for advertising or human use/interests.

The subtle reality here is that these technologies are not safe for the world, but can be profited from by businesses today in ways vastly different from how we just described. The reality is all technology ever invented has had the potential to cause great evil and great good. The good often struggles to catch up, panting heavily behind the detonations and the drone strikes and the profitting. A great engineer morality is needed for the future that we are entering. If the vision above brings horror into your heart, it's because you know the same technology can be used to create far different futures than catching fish.

Everything from de-centralized travel to de-centralized internet to de-centralized food production is possible with intelligence, but that level of abundance comes paired with human shortsightedness that risks making it *wrong* in ways that are not plainly obvious until drawn, painted, and credibly described, or worse, until manifested and actualized in the real world. Education is paramount, towards the understanding of deeper intelligence in humanity and toward's seedening humanity’s respect for the intelligences, wisdoms, and magics of nature.

Truth be told, we are environmentalists, tree-huggers, and crazy shamanic priests. Join us by [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/AGI-init) and contributing, and we will do right by you and nature, who governs and nourishes above all.

**Worry**: Sam, the vision you painted is horrifying. I want my comforts as they are now, my routines, and for nothing in the world to dramatically change.

Me painting it has nothing to do with it happening. It can be brought about beautifully in a way that doesn’t disturb you or it can blindside us the way Covid did.

**Comfortable and wealthy, but intelligent engineer**: Sam, you’re an AI doomer. 

Not really. I think the beautiful version of events is more than possible. But businesses can sell weapons to the Department of Defense and collect data in ways that violate user trust. Meanwhile, governments can use those weapons to continue their endless wars (for the sake of obsolete energy technologies) and spy on people. None of this doomerism is radical since it’s provably already happening.

**Why your business?**

Because it’s not even a business. Right now I just need support. 

Moreover, UnifiedML is really good. Really good, and can absolutely be used for evil since I’m releasing it open-source. I want to have a say in the role of a technology I put out in the world, a technology that can be used to build the very things described above — in their best light or their worst.

**I DON'T WANT TO DE-CENTRALIZE THINGS!**

Someone will eventually sell an infinite hungry-people-feeding drone to a commune or two and you are welcome to continue paying for fish at the supermarket.

One more thing. [Not to emulate Steve Jobs presenting the new Apple](https://youtu.be/x7qPAY9JqE4).

But in fact, we do want to present an Apple, an un-poisonous one. There is a lot of hidden knowledge in the intelligence of the universe, stemming back to the mystics.

But first, we have to follow a scientific process. Experimental evidence. A large part of this work will go towards the education of materials that haven't previously been disclosed.
