The limit of the character personifying my brain or at least my voice and associative reasoning is suspicious because I know I’m smarter than the — wait wait, how can I possibly write this under that premise if I’m not lying?

maybe I delved deep into topics that are infuriating and this limit in cognition is due to a mental place of dissociation from that infuriating set of events that my memory is stuck in.

then does some part of me exist that is infuriated? 

And does my memory have a grammatical structure that prevents it from teleporting to a different region of memories while the rest of me seemingly does transport to a different region of memories?

And is something else — that I’m not conscious of — sentient in those memories? 

---

The reason for this, I sense, is that some part of me seems to “know” (think) that something I wrote will be negatively judged.

I am not conscious as that part and don’t know why, in a mild-to-optimistic interpretation of people and things, what I wrote would be negatively judged. But yes, in a really severe interpretation, I know it can be negatively judged.

Somehow that possibility tortures me.

---

Every negative judgement would be really unfair. They would exponentially boil only into an interpretation of others as deranged, psychotic, or really unintelligent and lacking wisdom.

Honestly, it might be well earned self-pity

---

Maybe I can’t feel what I feel. Part of it is wanting to keep battling, even as this self-pity grievingly washes over, but not far enough to make my conscious understand.

Wait but how can I not feel what I feel? I do feel what I feel. 

Maybe the brain is composed of many parts and some of them don’t understand my full memory perspective. So I have to feel what they feel somehow through a spiritual process or meeting halfway if they will do that and if consciousness is navigated so easily, or dissociate. And that spiritual process isn’t about me, but about reminding those systems what I already know and remind them regularly, like “50 First Dates”. Speaking of, I already wrote this basic formula of an answer literally, just found what I wrote before in my notes, and even the “50 First Dates” analogy is rehashed, a movie I don’t really even like or remember?
