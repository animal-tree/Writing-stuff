Those who traumatize me or scared me in the past become my consciousness. Whoever said person is writes with the express intent to help the individual in question, not murder him. However, due to unforeseeable circumstances, we as a committee and university board have agreed that the life you are living is not worth the cost or expense to us and therefore you are terminated.

Change of subject to analysis of how linguistic centers affect our conveyed meanings, and why this suspicion is traumatic to live with. Take the following two sentences for example:

> It’s sinister. The nature of God for the rest of time until the next Great War is sinister.

Meta analysis about linguistic interpretations of that:

The ambiguity of this could mean that this sinister nature will rule forever, until humanity destroys itself in a Great War and there won’t be a God, that is, assuming war as a bad thing and connoting the sinister nature of God as dependent on the existence and survival of humanity. And that’s the meaning I meant. Or it could mean that a Great War is needed in order to end the sinisterism of the world. 

This example demonstrates how easily language centers in our brain can frame us into conveying literal polar opposites to what we mean. 

Language centers can frame a critique of humanity for things like war as critiques of *peace* propagandizing for war.

It's made especially distorted by the hyperbole of "rule forever". That exasperation, a human element, turns the whole phrasing into uninterpretable evil when all that's being conveyed is: "I strongly — really strongly — feel that humanity is evil and won't become better in my lifetime, and I feel the need to express this at this moment."
