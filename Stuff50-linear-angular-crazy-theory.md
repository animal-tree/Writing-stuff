First, classical description of local gravity:

Here is what I'm sure I could build: gravity from local interactions. Let's say we have bodies consisting either of their own distinct form of matter ("light matter") in the presence of "dark matter", or alternatively — more complicated to simulate but functionally equivalent — bodies defined by specific patterns of a single form of matter ("corpuscles") and the surrounding chaos of the same type of matter but unpatterned, e.g., like whirlpools on the surface of water. Then, defining these light matter or patterned corpuscles with a velocity and spin can give them unique interactions with dark matter or surrounding unpatterned corpuscles depending on their spin value. The dark matter/surrounding corpuscles can have no effect when only a single body is present, allowing for inertia. However, they can communicate between the first body and a second body in the presence of a second body, and thereby cause an interaction. This is describable as a cross derivative, where the presence of a second body increases the effect these intermediary particles have on the first body. Otherwise, the effect is negligible (inertia). Specifically, a waning pressure gradient can be propagated outward from the first body, then received and warped by the second body so as to affect the first one gravitationally, and then vice versa from the first body to the second body, together creating a gravitational effect based on just local classically-described collisions.

> This is a thought experiment about whether special and geenral relativity could emerge relativistically from an angular-linear velocity tradeoff in a universe who particles and bodies consisted of "corpuscles" all traveling at the same absolute speed consistent but just with varying directions (varying angular/orbital patterns detracting from perceptible linear speed).

Wouldn't we observe this anisotropy if our solar system was moving at velocity $\frac{n}{c}$ the absolute speed constant?

Well, it's possible by miraculous chance $n = 0$. Other than that, still perhaps not.

While this anisotropy would affect everything within our confined system differently, season to season, to us it would be imperceptible, as all the planet, atmosphere, and everything traveling in it would be likewise time-dilated.

What about light, as it reaches the Earth from the sun? Would it not span the distance at velocity $\frac{c}{c}$ in, say, the summer and $\frac{c-n}{c}$ in the winter?

Light would travel faster in one direction than the other... unless it were a harmonic frequency dependent on all directions equally. Back and forth, back and forth. And indeed light has a frequency. For every distance it must travel at $\frac{c}{c}$, it must also travel at $\frac{c-n}{c}$, and vice versa.

This back and forth could be the result of probabilistic shifts in its wave function, sampling velocities in all directions, in all respective relative magnitudes, iterating one then another — on average harmonically oscilating an isotropic rate of travel.

is that how it works? sample and iterate at every time step? I think so — plus account for collisions — in which case the distribution shifts gravitationally — or in some patterns — magnetically — accelerating in which may scatter waves of these corpuscles.

but if this is the case, would it not be the case in matter?

Or have these probability distributions somehow "stabilized" anisotropically? 

Maybe light in a vacuum is sampled uniformly randomly — isotropy — and light in a gravitational field is anisotropic — bent towards the attracting mass.

One question remains: why are photon velocities sampled "uniformly" when they are definitively traveling in one particle-like direction? Answer: it's not exactly uniform. The probability distribution is biased towards its direction of travel; however the other directions are frequentially sampled — hence it has a frequency. The faster relative speeds in one direction always "sum to 1" in the average case with all of the directions by the nature of it being a probability distribution. (this part is dubious)

Maybe EM is when these photons form collision patterns with themselves. E.g. monkey-in-the-middle in a sphere of gravitationally attracted corpuscles.

These and similar form a relativistically-isotropic basis for a relativistically-anisotropic universe. Meanwhile, those particles that do not, undergo time dilation (due to anisotropic orbits), perhaps literal length contraction (due to changing radii).

These former particles — photons —  exert no gravitational influence due to probability distributions focused inward (at the monkey(s)-in-the-middle).

ooor $n \approx 0$. How else would large masses form?

This is the main flaw of the linear-angular velocity tradeoff hypothesis. While it probably can be used derive the Lorentz transformation from a relative perspective due to literal mechanical time dilation and length contraction, and it's easy to simulate in a computer program, it suggests that the light's behavior relative to different-velocity mediums would not be the same. This is, generally speaking true, but specifically it suggests that light's behavior would be anisotropic, different from one galactic direction than another, or different at daytime than nighttime, or in one season than another. 

Even at $n \approx 0$, the galaxy and solar system and planet are moving at non-negligible speeds from which this anisotropy should be obersvable. There *might* be a hacky explanation defining light as some specific corpuscular pattern that requires sufficient movement in all directions that its behavior effectively becomes isotropic, but this would seem to be a pretty complicated construction of light that doesn't seem as simple/elegant as it could be, and it would mean that light would travel at a speed *slower* than the actual corpuscles being hypothesized.

The downside to this is that it's more computationally expensive to simulate wave-particle duality for than the probabilistic averaging idea.
