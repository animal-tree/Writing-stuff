# Dubious in progress

Wouldn't we observe this anisotropy if our solar system was moving at velocity $\frac{n}{c}$ the absolute speed constant?

Well, it's possible by miraculous chance $n = 0$. Other than that, still perhaps not.

While this anisotropy would affect everything within our confined system differently, season to season, to us it would be imperceptible, as all the planet, atmosphere, and everything traveling in it would be likewise time-dilated.

What about light, as it reaches the Earth from the sun? Would it not span the distance at velocity $\frac{c}{c}$ in, say, the summer and $\frac{c-n}{c}$ in the winter?

Light would travel faster in one direction than the other... unless it were a harmonic frequency dependent on all directions equally. Back and forth, back and forth. And indeed light has a frequency. For every distance it must travel at $\frac{c}{c}$, it must also travel at $\frac{c-n}{c}$, and vice versa.

This back and forth could be the result of probabilistic shifts in its wave function, sampling velocities in all directions, in all respective relative magnitudes, iterating one then another — on average harmonically oscilating an isotropic rate of travel.

is that how it works? sample and iterate at every time step? I think so — plus account for collisions — in which case the distribution shifts gravitationally — or in some patterns — magnetically — accelerating in which may scatter waves of these corpuscles.

but if this is the case, would it not be the case in matter?

Or have these probability distributions somehow "stabilized" anisotropically? 

Maybe light in a vacuum is sampled uniformly randomly — isotropy — and light in a gravitational field is anisotropic — bent towards the attracting mass.

One question remains: why are photon velocities sampled "uniformly" when they are definitively traveling in one particle-like direction? Answer: it's not exactly uniform. The probability distribution is biased towards its direction of travel; however the other directions are frequentially sampled — hence it has a frequency. The faster relative speeds in one direction always "sum to 1" in the average case with all of the directions by the nature of it being a probability distribution. (this part is dubious)

Maybe EM is when these photons form collision patterns with themselves. E.g. monkey-in-the-middle in a sphere of gravitationally attracted corpuscles.

These and similar form an isotropic basis for an anisotropic universe. Meanwhile, those that do not undergo time dilation (due to anisotropic orbits), perhaps length contraction (due to changing radii).
