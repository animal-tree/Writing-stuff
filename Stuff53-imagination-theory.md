### A philosophical breakdown of simulation theory

The simulation theory says that if there ever will be a man-constructed simulation of the universe, then the statistical chance of our own universe being part of a simulation goes up to infinity. Now the rapid acceleration of technology is used as evidence that this will one day happen, but the reality is that the universe that we live in might have a finite amount of compute and that finite amount might not be enough to simulate anything near to a universe as big and complex as ours. Even thinking that humans can one day harness the compute of a universe-worth of resources in order to simulate as much as we conceivably can under that constrained quantity changes the statistical odds that someone like Nick Bostrom, a simulation theory philosophizer, posits in the philosophy. That is because each constituent universe of each spawning universe is in all likelihood much smaller and less complex than its spawning universe, meaning that the aforementioned probability decays exponentially with each level in the turtles-all-the-way-down formalism right up until we hit the last turtle where no life can emerge, let alone a simulation of a yet smaller universe. So this is the problem of the simulation hypothesis. It doesn’t account for compute limitations in a potentially finite universe, and in fact, any simulation humans ever create will be finite, in all likelihood. That is, its citizens won’t have access to more resources than that universe’s Gods (us) and therefore their simulations won’t be as advanced as ours and so on with each diminishingly impressive layer, resulting in exponentially decreasing probabilities of living in a lower-level-turtle universe. The highest probability by plurality is that of living in the highest-level universe, not in a middle one. That’s not to say however that the simulation hypothesis is a total fallacy. The thought experiment gives us an analogy for one other process that I consider more profound than humanity’s technological acceleration: biological evolution. If, hypothetically, a biological creature ever exists that is able to imagine universes upon universes, and imagine people among one another, and oceans and cities and art and mountains and civilization and the animal kingdom and robots and river basins and the Alps and the Himalayas, what are the odds that we ourselves are not living in such an imagination?
