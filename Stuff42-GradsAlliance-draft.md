If you’re an undergrad, master’s, or PhD student, or university faculty interested in labor-reform: [Grads Alliance](). Join this group and protest [my unjust firing](), negotiate for the dignity of graduate employees (higher pay, basic healthcare including vision and dental, on-campus parking, W2 workers status), and bring back to spotlight the student loan debt cancellation plan that was passed, then unconstitutionally shut down by the Republican-dominated Supreme Court. Among other things, we propose that [universities are responsible for cancelling undergrad student debt](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/10/14/harvard-budget-fy22/) in light of the Republican-led decision. Since graduate workers are the core of the university workforce, our negotiating power, when united, is unlimitted. Academic workforces, join **[here]()** to take the power that is yours.
