Their second reason, after they changed their minds, was based on a 20-minute zoom meeting, with a brand new committee. Nothing unethical happened during that meeting. They then failed to respond to my assertion of this, except for one committee member, who admitted, on email-record, that he didn't even remember that meeting. (he thought I was someone else). The further systemic injustice is the medical practice and malpractice conditions at the University of Rochester Medical Center that the university IS responsible for.

> I couldn’t even take a medical leave because I have massive student loan debt from my undergrad at U of R. Yes, I have massive debt, that is subsidized for only as long as I’m a student because of my family’s poverty. In fact, it was approved to be cancelled $20,000 by Biden’s student debt cancellation plan because I was funded by the Pell Grant (in my undergrad; today I'm actually one of the authors of the major NSF grant that was funding me — er, minimum wage as a PhD student). My family immigrated from Uzbekistan when I was 4 as Jewish refugees. We have since faced SO MUCH injustice in THIS country. Me and my mom. Just us. My grandparents died. My sister is a nurse at RGH.

> Regarding medical malpractices, I’ll describe one to start e.g. insurance situation, university-provided no-less, mis-handling by both doctor and I-believe university-commissioned drug-provider. Prescribed for eczema, cut me off spontaneously 6 months in, doctor was nowhere, I lost all of my hair.

> As members of the department’s many email lists, you may have received a note this afternoon raising questions about the experience of a graduate student.  While I cannot comment on any specific case, the faculty, staff, and administrators of the CS Department and the Hajim School remain (and have been) committed to fostering a just and supportive environment, and to following our stated policies, as outlined in the URCS PhD handbook, the UR Graduate Handbook, and our broader Vision and Values.

> Michael, can you clarify where in the PhD handbook it says that a student with two publications (one pending) may be dismissed, last-minute and without prior warning, for “not enough papers” in their 6th year? In the middle of a paper-review response, by the way. Pending, with positive reviews. And having had no begrudging or otherwise “tacit” negative relationship with their advisor. Purely on that reason: “not enough papers”.
> 
> I know the reason was later modified to assert that my research over 6 years hasn’t been consistent. It has, with 2.5 hrs of weekly lab/group meetings with my advisor to ensure that it has, but the assertion itself was based on a 20-minute zoom meeting with a brand new committee.
> 
> Can I ask where in the PhD handbook it says that, if at the last minute a student’s committee members and/or advisor leave/get promoted/retire, that regardless of whether the student was notified in advance, that the computer science department would not in any way be responsible for sudden unwarned departures, and that the last-minute new committee’s opinions would be held as absolute? A committee whose advice following our one and only meeting was actually followed, as I reported to Chenliang on the day that he asserted that he would no longer support me in the Fall due to “not enough papers". 
> 
> Is it also permissible to ask where in the PhD handbook it says that a student in a rapidly changing tech field, is blamed for the rapid research changes that have to happen in that rapidly progressing field? The handbook should reflect accountability of the grad school for termination. That they need to give evidence, citing specific research examples, that the student over the course of their years of study, followed in opposition to advisor guidance. For example, my “UnifiedML” library, that I have been reporting on every week for about 3 years now, and is pretty much complete with novel robotics and foundation model methods equipped, was decided to be “unviable” in the very letter in which my stipend was formally terminated. How did those meetings, every week for many years, happen?
> 
> May I suggest an amendment to the PhD handbook? Perhaps it would be more fostering of justice and support if a PhD student’s research and contributions had to be weighed in the ruling about them as “inconsistent.”
> 
> May I also suggest that, if on email record the advisor is quoted as saying that the student has already done enough to successfully defend (indeed to do so as early as November, given that “you listen to my advice to format your thesis" correctly), that said student can’t in any just rationale be dismissed that same month for unsatisfactory research? 
> 
> These were the exact requirements given to me by the review committee:
> 1. before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters,
> 2. ﻿﻿﻿before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.
>    
> I was notified by Chenliang of the termination on July 24th, specifically that he would not support me “in the Fall”. Having no promise of funding (or an advisor), I emailed Chenliang and the committee members on August 10th to describe these events. Immediately, Chenliang replied with a lie, as well as the assertion that I could do my thesis if I just “formatted” it the way he recommended. I felt this would be a dishonest thesis, if I followed his advice, and then was terminated anyway this month due to my 6 years of research suddenly being “inconsistent.” I didn’t have enough for a thesis, in my opinion, and requested an extra year (out of 7) as well as reiterated the previously-mentioned situations, and of course the insanity of continuing to earnestly labor under an advisor who had just fired me and consciously/intentionally distorted truth. Without further discussion, they terminated me.

### Aftermath

Following this, one person in Chenliang's lab replied directly to me describing a similar experience, and asked me to convey it to the CS chair. The administrators changed their reason for terminating me one more time. Ultimately, it came down to the missed 6-month review (6-month reviews by the way are informal and meant to help the student, not to be a live-or-die assessment) that chronologically followed after the date when I was informed of my termination. They also explicitly stated/admitted:

> Your committee believes you could finish fairly soon if you would heed their advice regarding the research plan, but you have declined to do so.

I didn't decline anything. Said committee didn't even remember me in that one and only meeting we had, and one of the members explicitly realized this on email record. The University had no evidence for any of its changing set of reasons for terminating me.

Note: This was at the University of Rochester. The university just recently spent millions of dollars fighting to not fire one of its employees in a massive, nationally-sensationalized case. The hypocricy of demanding evidence in the Florian Jaeger case, where students objected to a professor's behavior, but providing none in this case in a PhD student's 6th year, on the bottom-line whim of one advisor and with no evidence, starkly reveals how the university actually thinks about evidence-based decision making.

Note: the decision to cut off my funding occurred arbitrarily, before the formality they ultimately used to justify the termination. This decision also followed two of my advisors and most of my committee members leaving, arbitrarily and in no way related to me, and was made entirely by people who literally had never met me during my 10 years there. I had to switch advisors in my 3rd year because my original advisor Henry Kautz was promoted to lead the AI division at the NSF. I switched to Chenliang Xu, who also decided to leave after 3 years due to me not having as many papers as he considered standard, despite my publication rate being about the same as my original advisor’s average doctoral student (I published two papers in those 3 years under Chenliang, in top venues). Besides what should be considered a perfectly reasonable publication rate, they had extreme evidence of my research talent and skill. From successfully innovating on the methods behind ChatGPT 5 years ago before anyone outside of a small niche handful of researchers heard of MHDPA to predicting and painstakingly teaching the professors at my university about every recent and impending research innovation, with my predictions always proving true even when they argued or doubted. All of this got forgotten and discarded ultimately in the decision made by total strangers in my final year.

I did everything that was required of me amid hospitalizations and medical trauma. I also exerted unthinkable discipline to stay functional during those times, including daily transcendental meditation; daily yoga; daily freezing cold ice baths; sacrificing movies, tv shows, social media, even music;  strict diet ranging from paleo to grassfed-pasture-raised-steak-and-wildcaught-salmon-only; daily walks in nature; 70-hour work weeks; and desperate attempts to still socialize every week. Note: if I took a medical leave, during the worst of the physical damage (following hair loss, and brain damage), I would have lost the subsidized-interest for my student loans. It was those disciplines that allowed me to meet requirements while literally brain damaged. Those damages were induced by the University of Rochester Medical Center's malpractices, something not even weighed into the University of Rochester's decision whether or not to terminate me while they profited from that med center's research, big-pharma drug agreements, and coercive psychoactive-drug prescriptions/administrations on me. The University of Rochester is literally a monopoly, both financially as a Rochester-wide power-center and over the thinking and consciousness of its students and workers, with no accountability.

I was assigned to a lab that my advisor didn't know was related to my research, and had to program for them for funding (in addition to regular PhD work). I also wrote the ideas for their grants later and wasn't credited.

Here is how I replied:

> Please provide evidence of research (not thesis-formatting) advice that was provided and not followed.

They didn't answer.

## Sincerely calling on the public

If you’re an undergrad, master’s, or PhD student, or university faculty interested in labor-reform: [Grads Alliance](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1600564167019335/). Join this group and protest [my unjust firing](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff55-workers-rights.md), negotiate for the dignity of graduate employees (higher pay, basic healthcare including vision and dental, on-campus parking, W2 workers status), and bring back to spotlight the student loan debt cancellation plan that was passed, then unconstitutionally shut down by the Republican-dominated Supreme Court.

### ...and expanding scope

[This](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/10/14/harvard-budget-fy22/) is almost enough to cancel all of Harvard's students' debt: the budgetary surplus of a single year. That statistic is of Harvard, but perhaps other universities can also afford to vastly reduce higher-education costs themselves and even cancel at least some student debt. You read that correctly: enough surplus to cancel nearly all debt for every student that ever went to Harvard, ever, from one year's *surplus*. Universities in the US make huge profits. I think it's their responsibility to use that money where the Supreme Court failed.

But even if they can reduce education costs or cancel debt, they won't without student and faculty and public pressure. Join [grads alliance](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1600564167019335/) since I haven't seen this bold, and legitimate, of a worker-and-public-led-pressure-campaign on university financial policy ever suggested elsewhere.
