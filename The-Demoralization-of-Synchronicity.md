It’s demoralizing. It makes us feel like “I pass butter.”

That feeling isn’t the “way” to which things are manipulated/orchestrated by God. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a good plan and he’d have, or he would’ve, died by now. To avert that, the synchronicity dread of “butter-passing” (Rick and Morty “Oh my God, I pass butter”), people need people and ways that give them hope for something. Sex. But also the version of that just as intense and perfect, but sustainable, infinitely recycling its infinite potential, where you and me see each other, and somebody sees us “better” than we do, oh and by better I mean better. They know you like you’re their soul and they love you.
