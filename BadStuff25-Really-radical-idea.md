We need more

(1) real-life "porn"

(2) no blocking each other

Our fantasies show us the distance between ourselves and nature. If you need movies, or porn, that distance is truer than the lie that says you are condemned to hide this part of yourself from expression. The same goes with blocked. We are one neural network. It can only function when the nodes are not hemorrhaged. 

What is meant by "real-life porn"? Thank you for asking. In my opinion, it's not what we see in porn. In my opinion it's the scarier things that we are not brave enough to express about ourselves with others, everything we repress in ourselves and others. Connection, intimacy, love. And touch. Touch is the only language we need. Beaches with bonfires where everyone is allowed with sex and love-making as normal and encouraged. Educational in-nature love-making between peers, as commonplace and public and not shunned as going swimming.

Animals intuitively sense this. We intuitively sense this with animals. When dogs run up to us to lick us, or a cat rubs her head against our ankle, we understand the gesture and interpret it, through a common language. Our common language for those gestures between human and human would separate us, categorically, from the rest of nature. We have that perspective with animal, but not with each other. How many of you would say "I love animals more than people." Most of us. 

"But our pets don't rape us."

Unfortunately, under the conditions that you put most humans, they probably would.

Or rather, they would eat you. Do you still love them? Sure, but you make sure not to starve them or repress them or systemically abuse them. We are the only repressed animal in the animal kingdom. We are the most intelligent, and have somehow put ourselves at the bottom of the only metric that counts. 

I speak from the center of the pain that boils humanity into war and disease.

This is a prescription for war and disease, if you need any more motivation. [Edit: internally, not internationally, but I'm sure it would extend spiritually in ways that can't be perceived right now]

That, and food bombs. On every enemy country.[^3] [^1] [^2] [^4]

[^1]: "Oh no a footnote he must have a really high rick-and-morty IQ"
[^2]: We also need teachers. Most of us, who think we know what sex is, don't. Those teachers haven't learned the spiritual "disciplines" or whatever the word is to understand what they're teaching, or teach it. A condom on a banana or open legs with pumping is like teaching a cow how to milk by pouring a carton on her head.
[^3]: Fastest way to end a war and its preeminent, emanating causes. Make the enemy dependent and grateful to you and never cut them off from their gratitude. Like a mom.
[^4]: I only get spiritual aid with my writing and argument when I share the most dumbed-out-me version of it. So, though embarrassed, this draft is necessary to my ability to make this point. Er, generally speaking.
