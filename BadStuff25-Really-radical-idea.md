I can envision something others can't. This perhaps comes from my background. I grew up in poverty, surrounded by stress, and without a dad. I had grandparents and my mom, and sister, and two cousins, and uncle. My grandparents, mom, sister and me shared one apartment. It was safe and full of love. A big part of me is pulling for me to screw up writing this because I want to express something radical. Coming from a guy the impression of this part of me — of this part of my brain, our brain — is "he's a predator by nature." I'm not. I never have been and never will be. But this part of me from the depths of our culture wants to tell me that I am. And you know what? As an immigrant coming from a culture where "priviledge" meant having a toilet... some of this modern language is bullshit.

So excuse the fact that I'm a guy and let me say this because the perspective that i have — moving from Uzbekistan, growing up with my grandparents — is pretty unique.

I have seen love in the safe throes of my apartment, where my garndparents and mom, and sister, were there for me. I have not seen it outside.

I had eczema as a kid. Severe eczema. Bleeding head to toe eczema. Like perhaps you couldn't imagine. But to this day there are severe outbreaks of it that are so bad I have crawl in order to move, and i can't unbend my arms without that itching scathing pain.

I also grew up mis-named. My birth name is Seamón or Soema, or the Americanized: Sim'on or Shimon. In Hebrew these names mean wisdom. In the Kabbalic teachings, two types of wisdom: seeing as the complement to hearing, hearing as the complement to seeing. But it was mistranslated. I grew up as "semen." from 3ish/4 to 11th grade, my name was legally Semen. Every bully and teacher and substitute teacher knew it. No one told me I could get a lawyer let alone a lawyer would do the process of changing the name for free! My mom to this day thinks it wouldn't have been possible before 11th grade, for free anyway. And we were poor. Lower-lower class poor. 

Maybe a lawyer and court would've sympathized with a kid wanting to change his name from "Semen", maybe not. But of course, it shaped me. Into being the odd weird "semen" that I am today. Anyway, I like Sam. Because Sam in all the fantasies and mythos' of modern time means "innocence." "Samwell", "Samwise", "Sam". It means "this person has a wisdom, but from the good of his heart, not his intelligence." It means "this person is naive, but he has a good heart." I like the name Sam. "Shimon" means "this person is wise through his intelligence." It's true, but it's not me all the time as, from this writing, you perhaps can see. I like "Sam" though.

So what all of this gave me is a unique perspective that no I've ever met has seemed to share or understand. It's a dichotomy, between that inner love safety of my apartment and the extreme hardships we were faced with outside. I see all of you as enemies at some *deeply* rooted psychological level, that I can't change.

I know what I need to heal and to ask for it would be to ask your culture for a really radical revolution. Something too progressive for even your open-minded hearts. But I think I can.

Some day...

The answer is love, as authentic in extremeness as the pain that systemic forces put me through.

the ideas i would propose however would be betrayed by you in a heartbeat. you'd shit on them with rick-and-morty memes or whatever and turn it into irony.
