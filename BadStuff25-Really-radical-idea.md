We need more

(1) real-life "porn"

(2) no blocking each other [^6]

Our fantasies show us the distance between ourselves and nature. If you need movies, or porn, that distance is truer than the lie that says you are condemned to hide this part of yourself from expression. The same goes with blocked. We are one neural network. It can only function when the nodes are not hemorrhaged. 

What is meant by "real-life porn"? Thank you for asking. In my opinion, it's not what we see in porn. In my opinion it's the scarier things that we are not brave enough to express about ourselves with others, everything we repress in ourselves and others. Connection, intimacy, love. And touch. Touch is the only language we need. Beaches with bonfires where everyone is allowed with sex and love-making as normal and encouraged. Educational in-nature love-making between peers, as commonplace and public and not shunned as going swimming.[^5]

Animals intuitively sense this. We intuitively sense this with animals. When dogs run up to us to lick us, or a cat rubs her head against our ankle, we understand the gesture and interpret it, through a common language. Our common language for those gestures between human and human would separate us, categorically, from the rest of nature. We have that perspective with animal, but not with each other. How many of you would say "I love animals more than people." Most of us. 

"But our pets don't ____ us."

Unfortunately, under the conditions that you put most humans, they probably would "____" you and so much more. What even is an underscore-underscore-underscore-underscore? I've never heard of it and didn't vote for it.

Or rather, they would eat you. Do you still love them? Sure, but you make sure not to starve them or repress them or systemically abuse them. We are the only repressed animal in the animal kingdom. We are the most intelligent, and have somehow put ourselves at the bottom of the only metric that counts.

Internally, not internationally, but I'm sure it would extend. Spiritual inner relationships are what make our outer ones.[^4]

Get grinding [^7]

That, and food bombs. On every enemy country.[^3] [^1] [^2]

[^1]: "Oh no a footnote he must have a really high rick-and-morty IQ"
[^2]: We also need teachers. Most of us, who think we know what sex is, don't. Those teachers haven't learned the spiritual "disciplines" or whatever the word is to understand what they're teaching, or teach it. A condom on a banana or open legs with pumping is like teaching a cow how to milk by pouring a carton on her head.
[^3]: Dropping food on warzones and their affiliated countries. years, unsolicited free food
[^4]: Actually, on a more academic note. It's vice versa.
  This deserves its own thesis.
[^5]: Orgies but sacred and ritualized, meaning educational and innocent, promoting relationships; or full blown-out drum-circle bananas 
[^6]: Alternatives to blocking: mute, pause, and wait.
[^7]: Honestly, this is hyperbole just to make this more relatable to the progressive cultures. I think it's not about that. Not in that connotation anyway.
