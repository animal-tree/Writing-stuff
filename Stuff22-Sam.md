# Observer: Sam

**Theorem 1:** Observation exists.

**Proof:** "I observe." $\square$

Whatever this function is, call it $o$. By theorem 1, $\exists o$.

**Definition:** Qualia and qualia. Every variable equivalent.

$\mathrm{I_1} = \mathrm{I_2} = \cdots = o$

These are just variables to describe the same constant.

By implication, we have:

$\mathrm{I_1} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_2} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow o$

and

$\mathrm{I_1} \leftarrow \mathrm{I_2} \leftarrow \cdots \leftarrow o$.

$\mathbb{Q} = \mathrm{I}_I \vert I \subset \mathbb{N}$ is Qualia, where any subset $I \subset \mathbb{N}$ will be referred to as qualia, lowercase.

By equivalence, $\exists \mathbb{Q}$.

We will now define and propose the function $o$.

**Axiom 1:** Disambiguated Qualia uniqueness.

$\mathrm{I_\mathit{I}}(\mathrm{I_\mathit{J}}) \rightarrow \mathrm{I}_{I,J}(\mathrm{I}_K)$,

where $I, J, K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$

and where $I_K$ denotes another observer, equivalent to the original. $K$ is selected by choice mechanism:

something something probably axiom about some qualia feeling better than others and observation being defined as distinguishing qualia and outputting qualia such that the "next" selection(s) can be made.
