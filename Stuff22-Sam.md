### Observation

**Theorem 1:** Observation exists.

**Proof:** "I observe." $\square$

Whatever this function is, call it $o$. By Theorem 1, $\exists o$.

**Definition 1:** Qualia and qualia. Every variable equivalent.

$\mathrm{I_1} = \mathrm{I_2} = \cdots = o$

These are just variables to describe the same constant.

$\mathbb{Q} = \mathrm{I}_I \vert I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is Qualia, where any $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ will be referred to as qualia, lowercase.

qualia are the "distinguishing traits".

$\mathbb{N}$ are not strictly the natural numbers and may not be infinite.

**Theorem 2:** Mutual causality.

Every Qualia implies every other Qualia.

$\mathrm{I}_I \rightarrow \mathrm{I}_J \forall I, J \subseteq \mathbb{N}$

**Proof:**

By implication of equivalence:

$\mathrm{I_1} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{I_2} \leftrightarrow \cdots \leftrightarrow o$

Then

$\mathrm{I_1} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_2} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow o$

$\mathrm{I_1} \leftarrow \mathrm{I_2} \leftarrow \cdots \leftarrow o$. $\square$

---

**Theorem 3:** Qualia exists.

$\exists \mathbb{Q}$.

**Proof:**

$\exists o$. By equivalence, $\exists \mathbb{Q}$. $\square$

**Axiom 1:** 

**1a:** The domain of observation is observation.

$o: \mathbb{Q} \rightarrow$

The range is left undefined for the moment.

**1b:** Observation observes itself recursively, and its qualia may branch into new observations.

$\mathrm{I_\mathit{I}}(\mathrm{I_\mathit{J}}) \rightarrow \mathrm{I}_{I \cup J}(\mathrm{I}_K)$,

where $I, J, K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$

and where the RHS denotes a recursive self-observation.

(or multiple branches of offspring $\rightarrow \mathrm{I_\mathit{L_i}}(\mathrm{I_\mathit{K_i}}) \vert \bigcup L_i = I \cup J, K_i \subseteq \mathbb{N}$).

**1c:** Disambiguated Qualia uniqueness.

$\mathrm{I_i}$ are not substitutable in the domain of the function that defines their equivalence.

$\mathrm{I_\mathit{I}}(\mathrm{I_\mathit{J}}) \not\rightarrow \mathrm{I}_I(\mathrm{I}_K) \vert J \neq K$

In other words, qualia are distinguishable in the domain of observers in Qualia.

Notice there is no contradiction to this in the definition of equivalence.

**1d:** Choice.

In 1a, $K$ is selected by choice mechanism:

something something probably axiom about some qualia feeling better than others and observation being defined as distinguishing qualia and outputting qualia such that the "next" selection(s) can be made.
