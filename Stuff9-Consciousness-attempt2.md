A flipbook probably can't experience human-like consciousness, at least not induced by the drawings in it. Even drawing a sufficiently advanced representation of the brain, with all the neurons and time steps, the flipbook, probably wouldn't be conscious as the way the human was.

Then consciousness is matter, not just representation. The simplest explanation is that it's in all matter, in a primordial form that increases in complexity.

By Occam's razor, this remains the best explanation.

Since there is no elementary particle for consciousness in the standard model of physics discovered as of yet, the most likely explanation is in the collisions between particles (or forces between them).

Entanglements that scale locally.

If that makes sense.

Do you agree that a drawing in a flipbook couldn't make the flipbook conscious as a human would be?

Most likely, yes.

Suppose you draw a biological brain in the pages of a big flipbook, its surface and depth perspectives with upmost precision, at time step $1$ on page $1$, time step $2$ on page $2$, up to time step $t$.

If consciousness is representation $c = r$, then that book is conscious. The absurdity of paper and pen producing human-like consciousness makes it a less likely hypothesis.

[There's a "known" laws of physics](Math.md) $\mathrm{R}$ s.t.:

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y)$

and causal hypotheses for consciousness that it's stemming from matter $m$ and/or representation $r$:

1. $\mathbf{P}((c, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x=m, h^{(0)}) \vert c, \mathrm{R})$
2. $\mathbf{P}((c, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x=r, h^{(0)}) \vert c, \mathrm{R})$
3. $\mathbf{P}((c, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x=(m, r), h^{(0)}) \vert c, \mathrm{R})$

We have shown, by the belief established thus far, that $P2 < P1$ and $P2 < P3$.

This leaves us with two competing leading suspicions: $m \sim x$ and $(m, r) \sim x$.

Now we turn to the dynamics model $\mathrm{R}$. We know that in the existing laws of physics, there is no known mechanism for how representation, even combined with matter, would give rise to consciousness. 

However, there is an alternate explanation for how the biological intelligences of consciousness could emerge, namely that the matter — specific matter — within or of the brain, collides and interacts to create the experience of consciousness. Not as representations but as specific chemical effects on that matter. 

However, in chemistry there is no known mechanism for how matter could interact to produce consciousness. Therefore, we could propose one more alternate hypothesis that does not alter the dynamics of $\mathrm{R}$: that matter is consciousness generally. That there is an equivalence between matter $m$ and consciousness $c$ ($c = m$), and its forces of interaction allow us to experience greater and richer forms of that sensation. 

Unlike $(m, r) \sim x$, this causal explanation of consciousness as matter does not add an axiom to the known dynamics of assumed $\mathrm{R}$, but rather an equivalence relation. For the time being, it remains the simplest explanation for an unknown phenomenon, not contradicted or shown improbable.

By Occam's razor, that makes it reasonable as a leading hypothesis.

Apologies if this is still badly written.
