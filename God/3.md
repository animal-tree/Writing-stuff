This is suicide, as all my actions are. No one warns me against it, but the tides of logic say “don’t fight the stronger man.” However the tides of spirit say “don’t submit.”

The belief in a good God in the absolute sense depends on this battle, and the result of this battle can conclude a 9-year journey of discovering what is God’s role in my life. Is He more a Destroyer, Preserver, or Creator? A Planner, a Rememberer, a Fighter? A Long-term actor or Improviser? 

These questions seem likely in the negative. 

But one thing remains upon obtaining this answer: the fact that my truth generalizes also to others, an unsharable but broadly impactful absoluteness of despair. 

What else? Ladybugs today of all days, as the pigs and fishes hop to the thread. Or ladybugs today of all days, as the God of Israel wakens his final warning. The God who led us from the wilderness. Look at him now, from Josh’s perspective. Look at him now, from Chenliang’s perspective. Look at him now, from the eyes and pens of Henry, Niaz, and Michael and the Deans. 

The God of the Israelites has brought us all the way to Canaan so that I may stumble on the last steps and crash beneath a pile of laughter?

Chris Kanan himself stands as emblem to the power and planning of the God of Israel, and we have lost this war on what grounds and at what time, with utmost disgrace and humiliation to Sam of Samarkand yet-more?
