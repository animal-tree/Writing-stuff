# Messages and notes from issa me, Sam Lerman

## Summary to friend

Life update is that I’m lonely. Theres nothing about me to want or like. I think all the mysticism I witnessed and documented is the cause of the spirits of people, forming power structures that are just as greedy and corrupt as the human ones, except with the additional power to regulate peoples consciousness and perhaps even control over physics to some extent. I think our collective consciousness spirits pretty much parallel our collective human societies and problems. I also think most of my life, but especially in the last 6 years, I’ve been obstructed by those forces. After all, I finished my ChatGPT paper 5 years ago in the hospital, barely functioning to run the last successful experiment. I don’t think the obstructions are because they knew I could’ve stolen ChatGPT early before it was made by the people who are worthy, or because they knew I could come to other research advances sooner that would potentially give me power or influence… but because I might have. And that’s enough to enforce preventative measures. It’s not because I was gaurenteed to be a threat, but I might’ve been enough of one and it presumably costs nothing to destroy a person’s life through deceptive mystical interventions. I’ve seen too many such woven interventions to question that something straight out of a schizophrenic’s delusions has connived for a long time to convince me to act on trust and faith in metaphysics rather than in my own direct best capitalist interests

Whatever exists in the world is bad. It’s the same as human governments and corporate powers. It’s not God. But it exists, has directly and deceptively intervened in my life, and I have too much evidence for that 

Anyway, most people would go into schizophrenia from this understanding. I’m desensitized to it. But this understanding is isolating because it’s about beyond what human civilization has even reached / needs to know about 

Unlike Star Trek where civilization has already solved all of its problems and is justified to spread its solutions to alien civilizations beyond where man has gone before, human society hasn’t even solved its own corruptions and deceptions. There’s no point talking about how corrupt some distant alien frontier of space is when there are extremely evident corruptions still on earth 

But that obstruction and the loss and the loneliness together create a miserable life. I want to be wanted. When I’m not wanted — and without hair / with severely trauma-damaged personality I haven’t been — I feel no motivation to do anything. And with the demoralizing reality of “schizophrenics are most right about the world than the most-right religions” and “these things can and will personality target me if I start to actualize anything too threatening” and “arguing this is possible but it’s impossible to prove” combined with “I don’t really have trust/faith in humanity” and “I’m alone”, what reason is there to do anything? For who? Why? To what disappointing exhausting goal? I have no hair and the world will literally connive to keep me powerless, I have a consciousness that is useless in social and romantic situations, and memories of years of extreme discipline to discredit the actual benefit of trying

And on the schizophrenic view that these things mind-control and so on, they do. Every cliche thing a schizophrenic has tried to express through an unconvincing set of language symbols, is in some form true

Meanwhile clinicians are telling them they’re sick unable to see the justified terror in their eyes

Summary:

- collective consciousness is analogous to human collective power structures
- but it regulates mind
- schizophrenics are mostly right
- I’m demoralized by memories of obstructed successes, wasted disciplines, suspiciously sabotaging mental states, false hopes, exploited faith/trust, and people and things that have been ripped away from me

It’s made more credible by the actual forecasting of each major innovation combined with intense obstructive mental states and metaphysical situations convincing me not to do them (side note, does it strike you as weird that the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, was fired a week after I was for some secret AGI thing called Q* in my specialized area of study that has been making sensationalized headlines?). Ah it’s also made more credible by synchronicities in abundance, none more extreme [than the ones around Tayler](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Does-anyone-else-think-this-is-proof-of-God%3F.md)

Credible is the wrong word. It’s not made more credible. Just more corroborated when context fully understood and known

## Summary to other friend

For some reason I can’t read that middle paragraph. Sometimes my eyes blur and become rigid. I don’t think it’s a symptom of schizotypy, so much as something internal or external that prevents me. I’m really suspicious of consciousness. I have no idea what it is or why, maybe it’s my brain sabotaging me with people, maybe there’s a hidden crypticism in  conversation that reading would somehow do something to my consciousness that my consciousness doesn’t want(?), I have no idea. Literally my eyes blur and the muscles sort of go rigid. Is it an intelligence or a psychosomatic delusion? Is it due to nefarious forces external to “me”, or crypticism / consciousness rules, or “psychosomatic delusion” like anxiety that I reflexively tense up to and then interpret as an external force?

[Edit: I wrote this with a different consciousness than the one I have now]

Edit twice: I read that paragraph. There was nothing in it to block my eyes from reading. My brain works against me.

——

Ignore that, maybe

Here’s the really long thing I wrote that I opted not to send. Divided into parts because character limit

Part 1

Yeah, that I extremely relate to. It’s suspicious when my brain keeps me from communicating. It feels exactly as you described. I have some suspicions about what it is and why, but I’m still figuring out. I didn’t know anyone else observed this in themselves and I don’t want to scare you

Does it vary based on who you’re talking to? I find that makes a huge difference. That, and arbitrary contextual things. Like if I’m writing on one platform I find my words are different than on another. And sometimes there are some people I go into full “psychosis” with — meaning, as my thoughts not just words becomes really contorted from what I’d identify as me, and I become a really stupid personality (not mean, just stupid). I guess another way of perceiving that is social anxiety, not “psychosis”, but the difference is that the consciousness change seems to happen independent from my actual anxiety, or comorbid with it

One example is stupid texts I sent someone. Nothing mean, just really stupid. And every time I’ve messaged that person in the last 3 years, it’s been like that

I had that happen with other people as well

Part 2

Meanwhile, I have other friends who by all means I should be intimidated by if it was just social anxiety, but who I can communicate really well with. I guess maybe I just trust them 

Some part of me may be aware of contexts and relationship reciprocity more than I might consciously be. That might be it honestly, reciprocity. I can count on some people to reciprocate my efforts or contributions to the conversation with some acknowledgement/appreciation. But there was one person who I had such a “psychosis” spell with and as far as I know I had no reason to be distrustful so as to send that stupidity. But then again I was sleep deprived and messaging that other person concurrently, so maybe that entangled into “psychosis” generally. But even then, I think messaging anyone else would’ve sobered and normalized my mind

It’s suspicious 

One interpretation is that there are planning mechanisms in the collective consciousness that are mediated by these interventions, for some higher planned purpose. As in, “the Gods wanted to sabotage my relationships for some [good] reason”

Another interpretation is “the gods wanted to sabotage my relationships for a [bad] reason” - so that’s why I’m suspicious. Because those relationship fallouts haven’t been justified yet 

Part 3

And then the “masking”/coping mechanism interpretation makes sense (“brain metaphorical-gods are governing my brain suboptimally for reasons that are not necessarily purposed”) but in my case those patterned situations make it seem like more than just situational masking, like literally something external is manipulating me. It’s also incongruent. I could message person 1 and have that happen disastredly and within the same timeframe message person 2 and communicate really well. So the “governing patterns” seem to have a semantically-intelligent mechanism behind them, able to discern who I am talking to and enable radically different levels of communication skill, yet make the decision without a purpose. It seems contradictory, it seems that purpose would be built into those mechanisms of intelligence capable of discerning semantic context. How can they be functional enough for semantic context, but not functional enough for [good] purpose? 

Part 4

Maybe I’m giving brains too much credit. Why would emotion and cognition regulation be governed by anything other than the highest wisdoms of the brain? Unless “I” am those highest wisdoms but then I would choose to be emotionally and cognitively/linguistically up to par in all social situations that mean a lot to me. But it could just be that emotion and cognition regulation happen at levels of consciousness lower than the ones responsible for the ones we’re experiencing, modulating for reasons that are impartial rather than intelligent/purposeful. Emotion/cognition regulation is a lot of power to attribute to a system of the brain impartial to purpose and [good], especially when there’s so much evidence that those faculties are highly intelligent. The way they’re regulated for example can give us subtle senses into complex social cues and dynamics. If they can do that, then they hav er one able to at least understand purpose and [good] not just from one’s own mind’s perspective but that of others. It’s suspicious if they can but govern for some reason not to, unless there’s a purposed plan

### Summary

I don’t know why these things happen. My best guess is some combination of shaping to other peoples’ judgements and meeting expectations. Perhaps the reason being some sort of authoritative hierarchy that’s enforced either culturally or between individuals, through communication patterns, potentially unconscious ones, potentially even language crypticism. These consciousness observations combined with observations of precognition and telepathy on enough occasions and convincing occasions suggested to me the interference is more than local. And with the many past outcomes of severe loss tragedy and suffering, convinced me that the overall intelligence of the system is low and probably by my personal principles evil. However this larger collective process works, it is far from “good” let alone “God” from what I can tell. Most likely given the [extreme] evidence of such instances I have and extreme evidence of those threadings having long-term harm in severe ways, my current general “ruling” about these suspicious mental viscera and the corresponding divergences from statistical precedent and my own personal background and past near-achievements, and the extreme suffering I’ve been through at odds with the extremely extreme discipline I exercised through great sacrifice and patience, is that the collective consciousness is evil, there is no worship-worthy God, and no divine natural force measurably stands up to optimistic interpretation, compared to, perhaps more conspiratorial (e.g. a corrupt centralized decentrality of greedy actors and power-preserving special interests in the ethereum unethically inducing cause and effect in the real world, sometimes targeted against individuals, for the same un-spiritually motivated reasons that humans have). I think whatever exists probably is humans at some level.

## Notes to self today

Reason for synchronicities:

– well intentioned deception

Reason for life injustice:

– power and comfort driven motives

Reason for the injustices caused by synchronicities being unjust or unresolved:

– unjust: A conflagration of mediating forces that fail to take accountability for their own and/or each other’s mistakes in the physical fabrics interweaving people or the entire universe. </br>
– unresolved: derivation in progress

–

Relationship to religion 

Now, are any of these views compatible with the known religions and any existing views on God? Yes. Those religions are all vague enough, in that they can disentangle this conflagration and these synchronicities from being attributed to God by attributing them to something else, such as a Devil. 

However, while there is evidence now for these mystical factors as having a nature other than a “good” God, such as that of a Devil, nor of anything holy other than as per polytheistic religions like Hinduism where many different Gods can be attributed this kind of injustice (though in that case, they do all presume to coalesce from one Brahman), there is no yet evidence for a monotheistic holy/sacred/divine (good) God. 

There is evidence we can create one, and I have some ideas how. And, hey, if He exists, maybe that’s what He wants. Unifying his kingdom first requires a translation in understanding, though, unfortunately, I’ve found that most people dislike the one I have!

More nefarious interpretations

Now that I’ve provided at least myself with these answers, I’m at a loss what to do and why given that both people and magic power structures are so despicable. Hence they again trick me into such a psychosis so as to keep persevering (well intentioned deception?) rather than commit suicide or waste what I may have solved for them. Though, to justify these psychoses as well intentioned would require justifying those earlier ones that were, from any plausible measure, more conducive to my suicide, not less. 

That raises a parallel question about psychosis, not just synchronicity. Are these mental states also accidental if they are patterned together with those synchronicities? Wherein the latter is measurably observed, not just projected. We’re talking synchronicity, not psychology. That is, physics, not their coiner, Jung. But why would physics, not psychology, induce psychosis?

Well intentioned?

If not, and there is reason to believe not, then the problem goes much further than “mistakes”. 

“A conflagration of mediating forces that fail to take accountability for their own and/or each other’s mistakes in the physical fabrics interweaving people or the entire universe.” $\rightarrow$ “Nefarious and conniving forces in the physical fabrics interweaving people or the entire universe.”

And that’s quite a thing to live with!

Meanwhile, no evidence yet of a mystical actor God.

Personal resolution due to no voluntary choice of my own

It’s a self-complete theory from which the only escape is distraction or axiomatically assuming it’s less true than the only other alternative, which is, too optimistic and too insane/ambitious for attainment*. Or suicide. Or maybe a good enough distraction that negates one’s concerns about the possibility of -all- of this. 

*maybe
