Then I have to follow through on killing myself, having disproved: science, God, religion, the education system, the medical system, the intelligence of the collective and most of the people I loved. 

God: “I have done more than enough.”

People I love. 

The synchronicities were misleading. The papers might barely make a dent. 

The hellfire that is your world, I can’t un-see. Frodo didn’t stay with Sam. After Mordor, he sailed to the Grey Havens, symbolic of death. 

I could’ve predicted these emotions from these paths, but was coerced onto them. 

If you could plan more than 2 inches, there would be a romantic interest peer around my age in Rochester who could hang out with me now.

Gideon put a fleece on the floor, respectfully. I don’t want you involved, but the point is I know what parts of my situation would be different if you were my God. And if you were, I would; but you’re not. You’re like Chenliang or the Vikings or emblematic of greed. 

Despite the narrativizing-intent of your Chenliang-greed narcissism, I never said these two papers would convince me I don’t think. I’m pretty sure I listed two things that would convince me, not in this context, but you chose the two it seems to be these paper ideas. 

Or I just derived them myself. 

<br>
<br>

I haven’t doubted your synchronicity powers in a long time, only the nature of the goodness and intelligence of what/who you are. 

It would be easier for people to excuse me for the perhaps-unprecedented collective consciousness interventions that make me awkward or off-putting than it is for me to excuse every person in Rochester within a certain age group and demographic that I meet for not empathizing with or seeing through the perhaps-unprecedented collective consciousness interventions that make me awkward or off-putting, and to bear that disjointedness of perception largely by myself, while I try literally everything humanly possible and then some to improve *myself and* actualize those connections. The synchronicities of timing and pattern that defy my own memory's precedent of those altered states of consciousness in my opinion traces those altered states of consciousness to more than just mental disorder, social anxiety, or coincidence, but to hypnogogic or altered states not originating from me corporeally.

<br>
<br>

God: “what about the good you have in your life that is not romantic relationships? Your mom, cat, free food and housing, no urgent responsibilities or work that you have to do, plenty of distractions if you want?”

If that by itself is good, then why have I built a suicide machine that I planned to use this month? Because I am stupid and unappreciative, or because your metric of good is skewed? I think the latter because I have proven my appreciation. 

I’m still planning to kill myself this month. And I don’t trust you. 

> Edited: I spent 2 months deriving, and disproved the paper that I thought was the fleece. Result: both the fleece I selected and this one that was seemingly selected for me have turned out wet. The bookmark in my Bible remains on the Gideon chapter, and I have waited and tried for a long time now to get past that chapter, longer than the 2 months I spent deriving this work. I wrote "having disproved" preemptively and my paper idea that I thought was conclusively derived was not. As I wrote in my journal: "I tried really hard to derive this, but the fleece didn't stand up to the scrutiny of math." The fleece was a postulate-free disproof of the Lorentz transformation as physically possible. Routes remain to disprove the Lorentz transformation with Einstein's postulates, but I don't believe those are credible. For example, Einstein's "the constancy of the speed of light *in vacuo* across reference frames" postulate requires $x=ct \rightarrow \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = c$, which contradicts both the [velocity-addition formula](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/BadStuff47-velocity-addition-formula.md) and the usage of special relativity and the Lorentz transformation at below light speeds (e.g. an electron). That's the whole disproof. Is that credible? Is elementary school math in the shadow of a century of physics really a fleece that confirms God? The credible disproof I thought I had turned out false. - January 26, 2024, morning.

Edited again (02/08/24): I think in all likelihood this [ongoing conversation](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff72-Ongoing-conversation.md) is the 2nd fleece-test. That would make the first the disproof, but, same as Gideon, I'm unconvinced. My own self-described [opposing views](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff65-opposing-views.md) to my esoteric beliefs are too strong. But above all, I question whatever exists' goodness. And the confirmation fleece-test would be the unambiguous yes/no result of whether humanity, and therefore God or whatever exists, deserves my faith. But to be clear: the result is whether I decide that humanity deserves my faith and [my continued presence](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff68-policy-proposal.md) on this [earth](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/indebted.md), not anything else. Don't commit me to this! I'm reasonable in letting God decide the fleece-tests, but if I'm not convinced, then Gideon's situation hasn't been reproduced, while many other parts of the Bible as I've been reading them chronologically have, with statistically unbelievable synchronicity. (But not so much so to cast away all [doubt](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/God/3.md)).

Noting at this point, I'm pretty sure I have [a conclusive disproof](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff67-Lorentz-disproof.md) and no, I don't want to live and am not convinced of all that this shit implies.

To be honest, I'm only including this in case I kill myself and someone reads this thinking, "oh wow look God was trying to work through you! Guess He must exist and is real and is good." No, I think this Gideon chapter conclusively proves it for me or not. The story of Gideon by the way is he puts a dry fleece down on a flooding floor, and tests whether the God who he thinks has tasked him is "the one true God." If not, okay. If so, fleece should be dry even after flooding. Then, after seeing the next day it's dry, he's still unconvinced, and asks God to let him test the physically-impossible situation one more time in order to know for sure.

Although for rigor's sake my original "test" (please Brain stop using that word), that I wrote unthinkingly and not in this context in my journals (and I'm paraphrasing because I'm too drained today to find my actual phrasing) was:

(1) Romantic relationship </br>
(2) The physics theories

I can credit (2) to my own intelligence, but (1) would prove to me God. Short of that, I'm writing here basically "believing that life is worth living" would be good enough. And that requires believing that humans aren't evil as a bare minimum, even if no relationship.

For the record, I know there's a 100% chance I'm going to kill myself, and everything on this GitHub embarrasses me.

I wish I could stop fantasizing about some imaginary friend (God), but the fact is that none of you love me (except my mom). My social status is lower than my old neighbor's who was a sex offendor, or the next one, who had a psychotic episode and banged violently on our doors screaming that he would beat me up. My social status was always in those levels. Here's what I just wrote to someone that I'll never get to share but I like it:

> People think I’m Sam (that is my name), but I’m Frodo, and because I look like Gollum, they sort of kind of just average who I am, Frodo, and what I look like, Gollum, and arrive at Sam. But, to reiterate, I’m Frodo.

Oh fuck off. This is so framed it's not even funny.

They're making it look like my email stands a chance. Oh if only I follow through! If only I keep exercising faith. It's public image "just in case" so that in case people discover this, they don't realize that contained within these repo links are ample evidence against the existence of God. But this is meant to cover their trails.

"Their" refers to the parts of my brain, tied into the collective consciousness, that are framing me as schizophrenic as I type.

And people who believe might read this and find ambiguity about "oh maybe oh maybe". This GitHub is one big ambiguity-preserving machine, so that the collective consciousness forces that rule all of us can maintain their power myths

---

Here is perhaps the answer: observe the synchronicities and what is asked of me from "God." Give the same in kind to humanity, as in, if God presents me with this small disproof and then asks me to do a lot of work because of the faith based on that small disproof, then show that small disproof (as I've done here) to others and see if they give the same faith, and willingness to work, in me.

---

Of course, spreading that small disproof now, would be in the context of Detective-Sam, which I made after writing this last part. I thought that some force helped me write it, I suspected for the purpose of measuring the fleece of whether or not to have faith as dry. I sent out the last email to Michael, and I don't know how the conversation will go or if there will even be a reply. I don't know how people would judge the GitHub if I were to share it.

My friend in her 40s also suggested I might have a demon via text. I'm the first to own that possibility, but being more secular, I usually mean metaphorically. However, because she depends on her faith, in God and Jesus, I told her something akin to "I'm sure there's a God" and I really don't mean that and probably shouldn't have told her that, for my own psychological comfort in knowing my own skepticism. I texted that out of empathy to her being single and childless, and how much faith she puts into the world, at least individuals, including in me, and in her Christian views and practices. I also precluded that and proceeded that with alternative explanations for things (collective forces) and my own doubt as being analogous to Gideon's. The "collective forces" suspicion actually does parallel Gideon's. In that chapter, Gideon doesn't know if the God who has tasked him is the God of his fathers or, for example, the Baal of Moab, a false God. [As I've described elsewhere on this GitHub](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/God/3.md), much of what can be recognized as metaphysical intervention can also be explained in other ways than just "God" and the evidence I have for a singular plan, or one that specifically revolves around me continuing that Einstein/Lorentz disproof and building that new physics model and theory, is slim. For reasons I don't need to argue or evidence, as most would and do agree. However, she's one of the best evidence of a good God I have, because the story about her, how I met her, and how I even got my Bible in the first place — something I never expected myself to seriously (meaning, more than just studiously or scholastically) read — is insane. And it's a Bible that accidentally got blessed many times. 

Here is an unsent message to a friend: "To write the disproof, I need belief. The second physics paper I have in mind, I also need belief. Belief in luck. I’m as certain as math that ~my papers are~ one paper is mathematically correct. But I doubt whether they’d have the impact I’d expect from a rational scientific audience, which I understand is something you believe exists, but it’s not something I yet believe exists [due to the disproof, trivial disproofssuch as [this one](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/BadStuff47-velocity-addition-formula.md), and 7 years of rejection in my field of ideas that later exploded, including innovations of the method behind ChatGPT and everything else I ever argued to my university professors] and have some pretty strong evidence to justify that doubt [including that maybe others have claimed the same, regarding disproving or evidencing against special relativity at least, sort of, and been ignored]." Then adding:

"The specific kind of belief I need to keep working is the belief in non-lizard-humans. Every human I’ve ever met is a lizard-human. I genuinely doubt any of you will respect truth when it’s there. Your leader is literally a demented 81 year old who you chose over Bernie Sanders, and his next-best competitor according to your world’s sanity is Trump."

This is meant with my sense of humor, and I didn't send it. The specific belief I need is that I'm not being gaslit.

I have a few areas of hope in my life and none of them seem likely. If the world wants me to do work, it should give me evidence that I specifically matter to it as much as what that work claims to be worth. Otherwise, I have to do all of that work with absolute doubt as to whether it will have any benefit to me or impact to others, and without pay.

That's what Gideon's fleeces were about.

That person blocked me after I unambiguously-to-myself acted on faith in her.  Whether she knew it or not, that was a conclusive disproof of acting on faith when emotional realities don't quite align. Her point about praying also was pretty heavily disproven since I prayed, "I pray she didn't block me." She's amazing though and I still have faith that whatever reason she had, was good and aligned with something higher and connected to the source of what the universe wants. However, whatever that is is unclear to me because I'm on the Gideon chapters and have not had my doubts addressed. If anything, her blocking me is a reminder of how much others will ultimately side against me, often times for reasons that leave me nothing but confused and hurt and extremely surprised. I love her and genuinely believe God/something-deeper told her to block me, and that it was not her misunderstanding or misjudgement. Perhaps the message was indeed to me, "don't have faith / don't gamble on questionable senses / don't cast 'lots' in fear and accidentally sell your two daughters." 

> Turned out they didn't block me. Replied a little later normally. Even the texts my phone said weren't delivered were received. She's going to be in Africa for sometime, but can walk with me after that. Still encourages praying.

Here is something I wrote to God:

> I don’t believe in you. The deleted reddit post tells me you’re erasing memory conspiratorially. I was hospitalized when I was working ahead of the curve on MHDPA. I think you are an establishment preservation force, some co-conspirator or collection of co-conspirators in authority who wants to maintain power and has low moral ability. You’ve destroyed my life and fighting you is futile because you control my psychology and emotions and thoughts and perceptions and understandings at times, and puppeteer the world in its established ways. All I can do is finish my suicide note and commit suicide. I think everyone I know becomes a sleeper-agent for you. You also deleted the CMT record. You’ve left me with no reason to believe in you, except for synchronicities, bare-minimum luck (overshadowed by extreme tragedy and misfortune), and a paper that I expect will get ignored. My revenge against you is solid though: I can’t read more of the Bible while its meanings remain absurd.

I wrote that paper in the same year as the benzo brain damage that stopped me from working on that direction. That reddit post from >3 years ago was my best summary of all of my trauma, and it was deleted. I have no backup in my notes. It was up just 5 months ago. Same with the CMT record of the paper. Microsoft emailed just months ago that, since conferences have switched from CMT to OpenReview, that they would be purging all of those records. Trauma and achievement both buried as if they didn't happen. MHDPA is the method behind ChatGPT that no one at my university heard of back then. I finished the paper in the hospital, running the last successful experiments from there. My advisor at the time argued against the research direction, and didn't agree with me referring to the method as "relational reasoning" even though that's how it's ubiquitously referred to today.

Josh re-entering my life just as I was reading the Joshua chapter was a big coincidence. My apartment neighbor, who lives where my grandparents used to before they died, went insane. He had a psychotic episode centered around me. The Rochester Police Department and all of our neighbors can confirm. He started banging on my apartment door and screaming, including threatening to beat me up if I came out. He kept doing this for weeks, just as I was texting Josh. Josh, my best friend, returned and is the only person who appreciates and understands me and my full perspective fully. He also went to Mt. Sinai for his PhD when I still had social anxiety, and spoke many of the political opinions I shared with him literally from those podiums since he was a major organization leader. But now he was emlematic of Joshua, a chapter about the Israelites re-conquering the land of Canaan (Israel). My neighbor, who lived in my grandparents' old apartment, had to move. At the same time, I was battling PhD committee members. One of them had just been put on my committee by chance, a newly added committee member named Chris Kanan. His last name Kanan is pronounced like Kanan and *deus ex machinas* kept happening with him during the back-and-forths in which he provably mis-remembered huge details and stated on record that I should do less, not more. His rushed replies also got me to send more concrete details about my AI plan on record via email. His superconcious, I suspect, participated in something beautiful. Or, it would've been beautiful if any of it had a point. Josh re-entering my life could partially be attributed to why I couldn't bend my knees to the University people and try to suffer all of what they demanded, enough that maybe (*maybe*) they would avoid terminating me. That's because Josh encouraged me to lay off some of my extreme disciplines that I was doing for years and to cut myself way more slack in terms of allowing myself to watch movies and shows again. Maybe that extra slack made it impossible for me to accept the impossible demands of the university enough to possibly negotiate not being terminated with them. Also, the neighbor who went psychotic was replaced with a new neighbor. He moved out of his own volition after his episode winded down, probably out of embaressment. His episode centering around me wasn't prompted, since he and I barely interacted. Maybe he didn't like my experimental phonetics when I said hi, that were induced on me by conscousness forces for those years as well. He's the second neighbor here to go psychotic during my PhD in a way that seemed to revolve around ongoing events in my life, and my own consciousness changes. I describe the other neighbor, a few years ago, in part [here](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Does-anyone-else-think-this-is-proof-of-God%3F.md).
