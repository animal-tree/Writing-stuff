Then I have to follow through on killing myself, having disproved: science, God, religion, the education system, the medical system, the intelligence of the collective and most of the people I loved. 

God: “I have done more than enough.”

People I love. 

The synchronicities were misleading. The papers might barely make a dent. 

The hellfire that is your world, I can’t un-see. Frodo didn’t stay with Sam. After Mordor, he sailed to the Grey Havens, symbolic of death. 

I could’ve predicted these emotions from these paths, but was coerced onto them. 

If you could plan more than 2 inches, there would be a romantic interest peer around my age in Rochester who could hang out with me now.

Gideon put a fleece on the floor, respectfully. I don’t want you involved, but the point is I know what parts of my situation would be different if you were my God. And if you were, I would; but you’re not. You’re like Chenliang or the Vikings or emblematic of greed. 

Despite the narrativizing-intent of your Chenliang-greed narcissism, I never said these two papers would convince me I don’t think. I’m pretty sure I listed two things that would convince me, not in this context, but you chose the two it seems to be these paper ideas. 

Or I just derived them myself.

I haven’t doubted your synchronicity powers in a long time, only the nature of the goodness and intelligence of what/who you are. 

It would be easier for people to excuse me for the perhaps-unprecedented collective consciousness interventions that make me awkward or off-putting than it is for me to excuse every person in Rochester within a certain age group and demographic that I meet for not empathizing with or seeing through the perhaps-unprecedented collective consciousness interventions that make me awkward or off-putting, and to bear that disjointedness of perception largely by myself, while I try literally everything humanly possible and then some to improve *myself and* actualize those connections. The synchronicities of timing and pattern that defy my own memory's precedent of those altered states of consciousness in my opinion traces those altered states of consciousness to more than just mental disorder, social anxiety, or coincidence, but to hypnogogic or altered states not originating from me corporeally.

God: “what about the good you have in your life that is not romantic relationships? Your mom, cat, free food and housing, no urgent responsibilities or work that you have to do, plenty of distractions if you want; or the ability to sacrifice those things and hang out with Josh and Nicole maybe?”

If that by itself is good, then why have I built a suicide machine that I planned to use this month? Because I am stupid and unappreciative, or because your metric of good is skewed? I think the latter because I have proven my appreciation. 

I’m still planning to kill myself this month. And I don’t trust you. 

> Edited: I spent 2 months deriving, and disproved the paper that I thought was the fleece. Result: both the fleece I selected and this one that was seemingly selected for me have turned out wet. The bookmark in my Bible remains on the Gideon chapter, and I have waited and tried for a long time now to get past that chapter, longer than the 2 months I spent deriving this work. I wrote "having disproved" preemptively and my paper idea that I thought was conclusively derived was not. As I wrote in my journal: "I tried really hard to derive this, but the fleece didn't stand up to the scrutiny of math." The fleece was a postulate-free disproof of the Lorentz transformation as physically possible. Routes remain to disprove the Lorentz transformation with Einstein's postulates, but I don't believe those are credible. For example, Einstein's "the constancy of the speed of light *in vacuo* across reference frames" postulate requires $x=ct \rightarrow \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = c$, which contradicts both the [velocity-addition formula](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/BadStuff47-velocity-addition-formula.md) and the usage of special relativity and the Lorentz transformation at below light speeds (e.g. an electron). That's the whole disproof. Is that credible? Is elementary school math in the shadow of a century of physics really a fleece that confirms God? The credible disproof I thought I had turned out false. - January 26, 2024, morning.
