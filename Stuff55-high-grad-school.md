### Worker’s rights

I like to keep my discussion to just the tragedies that happened to me during the PhD. It’s almost incongruent to bring up the eczema I had since I was 1-month old — full body and severe — the allergies, asthma, and social anxiety. Then being an immigrant, growing up without a dad, growing up in socioeconomic conditions that were really disadvantaged, including that my Russian-Jewish family were lower-lower economic class financially and my grandparents and mom and sister and me lived in one apartment, all supported by my mom. I could mention that my name, pronounced Siimón (Shimon, or SIM-ohn) was mistranslated as “Semen” by the Uzbek translators when we immigrated and that I lived with that name until 11th grade. I had to ride a pink bicycle with a crooked handlebar that was donated to us by the Synagogue because we couldn’t afford a normal boy-gendered bike. I could discuss how hard I worked despite health issues through high school and college, and my lack of meaningful romantic relationships, which I do think is a valid problem. But during the PhD, I guess I really learned “how the real world works” as my university’s stupid professors say when justifying their arbitrary hardship policies. Yes, with multiple medical malpractices from that very university and being terminated on a dime with no evidence or reason to justify why — yes, those professors and academic elite definitely know a thing or two about how the real world works in their academic bubbles: worker’s rights be damned. I didn’t learn my lesson, but maybe someday, if I can come back with a Jim-from-The-Office facial expression and some public backing, they might.

### Edited

My name is Siímyon. It’s pronounced as if you’re about to say “sim” but you change course as if you’re now about to say “sea”. Then the “yon” gets pronounced as if you’re about to say “you” and then as if you’re about to say “ohm” like the Buddhist chant. In total, it sounds like “Si-eam-y-ohn”. I’ve hyphened the “y-o” because the “y” initially sounds like you’re about to say “you” but that “ou” doesn’t get pronounced. 

In Russia and the former Soviet Union, this is a relatively common name. My great aunt’s (grandma’s sister’s) husband, who died before I was born (about 4 years before), had this name. The great aunt I knew most of my life as Tsotya (Aunt) Tsilia moved to America before us. When I moved (as a 4 year old, with my mom and older sister), the Uzbek government mistranslated it as “Semen” and I lived with that as my legal name until 11th grade of high school, when a lawyer was able to agree to change it “pro-bono.” We were poor and legally changing names wasn’t easy or affordable (1995 - 2012, just prior to the accelerated progress of the trans-rights movement). None of the teachers or substitute teachers or students, who knew about my name being Semen or announced this during name-call or bullied me about this, told us that there may have been a way to have the name changed for free sooner. To this day, my mom thinks it wasn’t possible and it indeed probably wasn’t. 

“Lerman” means “to teach.” My Rabbi told me that the Hebrew translation (of Siímyon) is “Shimon,” which in Kabbalistic teachings means “to hear,” the complement in the Kabbalistic duality of wisdom to “seeing”. Also Símon, Simeon, or Simon. However, I’ve always went as “Sam” with Americans. My family usually called me “Saoma”, “Somachka”, or “Sóm”. Though I like the “hearing” analogy since my mom was a music teacher (and she was a music theory professor at a music college where we moved from, er, “Samarkand”). Here, in America, she got another degree, in addition to her master’s in music theory, in computer information systems at a community college and worked a second job to make money to support all of us (including my retired, and later sick grandparents) as a computer tutor at that community college, MCC (Monroe Community College). That community college is also the only place I ever took a formal physics course after high school, during a summer, and the credit didn’t transfer because my university didn’t allow physics credits to be matriculated from community colleges.

Both of my uncles, who moved to America as well, were physicists. One of them, my mom’s brother, my “Dyada” (Uncle) Slava, was a genius physicist who I psychologically compare to Einstein. He did a lot of research in the Soviet Union and much that got copied or uncredited. And my other “Dyada” (Uncle), Tsotya Tsilya’s son, “Dyada” Sasha, is a professor at RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology), a different university from the one in Rochester I went to, U of R (University of Rochester). 

The motto of my Alma Mater, “UR”, is “Meliora,” which means “ever better” in Latin. I think the University of Rochester is a monopoly that lacks any accountability, but “ever better” is a good teleological standard that I hope they put their money to some day, not just their mouths. Some day, accountability should be recognized as a common-sense wisdom as much as “pro-bono” changing of a kid’s name from “Semen” (if he so wants) thankfully is today. Firing your hardest worker for no legitimate reason is a worker’s rights violation that is no way investigated, criticized, or remediated by current practices and current laws surrounding graduate workers such as PhD students, graduate schools, and other universities across the nation, a power that is especially dangerous in fields like AI, where rushed proliferations can lead to technologies that are weaponized, used for surveillance, or exploited without due consideration to broader implications. Such pressure to work and publish faster is unethical to put on anyone, especially not in militarizable fields. Furthermore, grad workers bring in most of the university’s research and research money, which comes from those grad workers’ effort and the grants that they help write and come up with; yet they receive less than minimum wage today and in some cases — as in my case — get terminated in their final year with no accountability for no reason, thus robbing them also of the doctoral degree by which the submission of power was presumably justified. 

Under President Obama, grad students were still considered W2 workers, which of course they should be since they are responsible for most of the university’s research and often grant funding and leading teaching assistantships. Under Trump, this classification was stripped and the 60-70 hour work week of a PhD student was reclassified. Instead of stipends being “earned”, they are now officially “awarded”, like gifts, in exchange for unthinkably high-pressure self-non-serving work. 

Suffice it to say, my experience in grad school was about as unjustly, almost laughably, bad as my experience in high school, except this time with the administrators unambiguously accountable and the circumstances highly preventable had there been reasonable leadership and policy; and the hypocrisy — given their other recent scandal, the not-mentioned refusal to terminate a different worker — nakedly stark.

Note: the decision to cut off my funding occurred arbitrarily, before the formality they ultimately used to justify the termination. This decision also followed two of my advisors and most of my committee members leaving, arbitrarily and in no way related to me, and was made entirely by people who literally had never met me during my 10 years there. I had to switch advisors in my 3rd year because my original advisor Henry Kautz was promoted to lead the AI division at the NSF. I switched to Chenliang Xu, who also decided to leave after 3 years due to me not having as many papers as he considered standard, despite my publication rate being about the same as my original advisor’s average doctoral student (I published two papers in those 3 years under Chenliang, in top venues). Besides what should be considered a perfectly reasonable publication rate, they had extreme evidence of my research talent and skill. From successfully innovating on the methods behind ChatGPT 5 years ago before anyone outside of a small niche handful of researchers heard of MHDPA to predicting and painstakingly teaching the professors at my university about every recent and impending research innovation, with my predictions always proving true even when they argued or doubted. All of this got forgotten and discarded ultimately in the decision made by total strangers in my final year.

### The public and its judgement

When the University terminated me, I reached out on two fronts. First, I tried my damned best to relay all of my perspective as fast as I could in a short time span before that paycheck ceased. After seeing that go nowhere, namely the professors replying with usual formal platitudes and stubbornness, and having my consciousness warped in that moment — either by panic or circumstance beyond understanding — I turned to the public. First, I messaged the administrators and gave them a proper, mostly-sincere heads up that I was going to message the entire graduate community. And I showed them the email I was going to send. Then, several days later, I sent. And they (university administrator) replied with the usual trite blockade of formalities about the university’s virtues and principles, and dismissed my description, again not believing me, and again missing the point badly.

The second time, I replied to their reply and that time I outlined the chronology of events and made a pretty inscrutable argument, that put their actions in a bitesize nutshell for them, as well as hopefully for the student body, to get perspective on. And they did. Their (the administrator’s) next reply mentioned reinstatement, once again changed their reason for firing (this time to the most ridiculous reason yet, as described towards the end [here](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff42-GradsAlliance-draft.md)), and terminated me conclusively once and for all.

However, I wasn’t surprised by their termination. Last-minute morality judgements are hard on computer science experts and graduate administrators and deans who can’t possibly comprehend the responsibility that they’re neglecting. That’s true. They’re a small group of incompetent administrators, not the collective itself. The collective is my worry, even though it’s these administrators whose abuses and negligences should be reprimanded and prevented in the future. Because this is a time when farcical reactions from the public, in response to mediocre crimes are more common than actual actions in actual incidents of injustice, or, as in the case of my University, a disproportionate focus on one type of injustice over another.

My University had recovered recently from a cancel-culture scandal, where one of the professors hosted parties and illicit activities with his grad students, and allegedly created a sexualized atmosphere. His termination was called for, by the entire student body (including me actually, at the time, nuances notwithstanding) and soon the entire media and nation. The scandal sensationalized to national prominence, the University spent millions of dollars in defense of, well, evidence-based termination I guess, and then ultimately fired a dean and not that professor.

My termination however was ignored. I also want to mention that another student reported the same urgent paper production environment and this is a worker’s rights issue in my opinion. In my opinion, much more in addition to that in the ultimate decision to terminate me was a worker’s rights issue, especially the untrue, un-evidenced, and inconsistency-of reasons culminating in an altogether ridiculous one that formalized the finalized decision. Not to mention concurrent huge medical tragedies, my own funding-grants, doing the work that was required of me, and being literally indentured by student debt to that universty.

I relayed all of this and no student, no graduate organization stood up for me. I got a LinkedIn request from somebody.

### Placeholder

Most of the people except my advisor, including most of my newly instituted 6-month review committee who made the decision, were people I never met in person nor got invitation to meet in person prior to or after the termination, though consciousness changes were the most suspicious element of these non-local interactions and would have made those meetings bizarre anyway…

As for the consciousness changes regarding these non-local interactions and weaponizable AI, that deserves its own discussion…
