My name is Siímyon. It’s pronounced as if you’re about to say “sim” but you change course as if you’re now about to say “sea”. Then the “yon” gets pronounced as if you’re about to say “you” and then as if you’re about to say “ohm” like the Buddhist chant. In total, it sounds like “Si-eam-y-ohn”. I’ve hyphened the “y-o” because the “y” initially sounds like you’re about to say “you” but that “ou” doesn’t get pronounced. 

In Russia and the former Soviet Union, this is a relatively common name. My great aunt’s (grandma’s sister’s) husband, who died before I was born (about 4 years before), had this name. The great aunt I knew most of my life as Tsotya (Aunt) Tsilia moved to America before us. When I moved (as a 4 year old, with my mom and older sister), the Uzbek government mistranslated it as “Semen” and I lived with that as my legal name until 11th grade of high school, when a lawyer was able to agree to change it “pro-bono.” We were poor and legally changing names wasn’t easy or affordable (1995 - 2012, just prior to the accelerated progress of the trans-rights movement). None of the teachers or substitute teachers or students, who knew about my name being Semen or announced this during name-call or bullied me about this, told us that there may have been a way to have the name changed for free sooner. To this day, my mom thinks it wasn’t possible and it indeed probably wasn’t. 

“Lerman” means “to teach.” My Rabbi told me that the Hebrew translation (of Siímyon) is “Shimon,” which in Kabbalistic teachings means “to hear,” the complement in the Kabbalistic duality of wisdom to “seeing”. Also Símon, Simeon, or Simon. However, I’ve always went as “Sam” with Americans. My family usually called me “Saoma”, “Somachka”, or “Sóm”. Though I like the “hearing” analogy since my mom was a music teacher (and she was a music theory professor at a music college where we moved from, er, “Samarkand” — get it, *Sam*arkand). Here, in America, she got another degree, in addition to her master’s in music theory, in computer information systems at a community college and worked a second job to make money to support all of us (including my retired, and later sick grandparents) as a computer tutor at that community college, MCC (Monroe Community College). That community college is also the only place I ever took a formal physics course after high school, during a summer, and the credit didn’t transfer because my university didn’t allow physics credits to be matriculated from community colleges.

Both of my uncles who moved to America as well were physicists. One of them, my mom’s brother, my “Dyada” (Uncle) Slava, was a genius physicist who I psychologically compare to Einstein. He did a lot of research in the Soviet Union and much that got copied or uncredited. And my other “Dyada” (Uncle), Tsotya Tsilya’s son, “Dyada” Sasha, is a professor at RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology), a different university from the one in Rochester I went to, U of R (University of Rochester). 

The motto of my Alma Mater, “UR”, is “Meliora,” which means “ever better” in Latin. I think the University of Rochester is a monopoly that lacks any accountability, but “ever better” is a good teleological standard that I hope they put their money to some day, not just their mouths. Some day, accountability should be recognized as a common-sense wisdom as much as “pro-bono” changing of a kid’s name from “Semen” (if he so wants) thankfully is today. Firing your hardest worker for no legitimate reason is a worker’s rights violation that is no way investigated, criticized, or remediated by current practices and current laws surrounding graduate workers such as PhD students, graduate schools, and other universities across the nation, a power that is especially dangerous in fields like AI, where rushed proliferations can lead to technologies that are weaponized, used for surveillance, or exploited without due consideration to broader implications. Such pressure to work and publish faster is unethical to put on anyone, especially not in militarizable fields. Furthermore, grad workers bring in most of the university’s research and research money, which comes from those grad workers’ effort and the grants that they help write and come up with; yet they receive less than minimum wage today and in some cases — as in my case — get terminated in their final year with no accountability for no reason, thus robbing them also of the doctoral degree by which the submission of power was presumably justified. 

Under President Obama, grad students were still considered W2 workers, which of course they should be since they are responsible for most of the university’s research and often grant funding and leading teaching assistantships. Under Trump, this classification was stripped and the 60-70 hour work week of a PhD student was reclassified. Instead of stipends being “earned”, they are now officially “awarded”, like gifts, in exchange for unthinkably high-pressure self-non-serving work. 

Suffice it to say, my experience in grad school was about as unjustly, almost laughably, bad as my experience in high school, except this time with the administrators unambiguously accountable and the circumstances highly preventable had there been reasonable leadership and policy; and the hypocrisy — given their other recent scandal, the not-mentioned refusal to terminate a different worker — nakedly stark.

Note: the decision to cut off my funding occurred arbitrarily, before the formality they ultimately used to justify the termination. This decision also followed two of my advisors and most of my committee members leaving, arbitrarily and in no way related to me, and was made entirely by people who literally had never met me during my 10 years there. I had to switch advisors in my 3rd year because my original advisor Henry Kautz was promoted to lead the AI division at the NSF. I switched to Chenliang Xu, who also decided to leave after 3 years due to me not having as many papers as he considered standard, despite my publication rate being about the same as my original advisor’s average doctoral student (I published two papers in those 3 years under Chenliang, in top venues). Besides what should be considered a perfectly reasonable publication rate, I had extreme evidence of my research talent and skill. From successfully innovating on the methods behind ChatGPT 5 years ago before anyone outside of a small niche handful of researchers heard of them to predicting and painstakingly teaching the professors at my university about every recent and impending research innovation, with my predictions always proving true even when they argued or doubted. All of this got forgotten and discarded ultimately in the decision made by total strangers in my final year.
