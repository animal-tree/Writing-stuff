By keeping things symmetrical and automated, the majority of computation can be concentrated. That is, the vast majority of space can be automated while fine-level probabilistic shifts could happen, inter-communicably between each other, at the particle level locally. Infinite cosmic potential, itty bitty living space. 

Perhaps there’s a constant flux of random local collisions that keep track of thought, memory, etc. in the bounds of local spacetime, a literal particle brain of signal communications via, certain probabilistic modulations. Maybe it’s not that nonlocal, but ends up being since everything is somehow connected, if the particles are doing the mediation and communication. 

This is different from the cryptic super-network of superconscious beings communicating, collectively, as the social or unconscious collective consciousness, via symbol. Or worse, the interpretation of the superconscious as being that and mediated by that. 

It may be mediated, as such, but to achieve practical-non-locality, a necessity for higher intelligence, it, the mechanism, would have to be communicable across symbolism limitations. Particles can do that. Language, non-transcendent of symbolism, can’t. 

Every part of observable space is literally connected. And perhaps there is a communication delay, e.g. the speed of light or gravity. A photon connects a part of a distant galaxy to ours. It may carry itself a literal communication beyond just its exact definition, but in its probabilistic behavior. 

This interpretation of local entanglement extending to the global scope as a receptive field, is one that is much more optimistic about the nature of nature. 

Nature’s potential would then be extraordinary in exacting her will. 

Better yet, she just controls everything all at once.
