The limit of the character personifying my brain or at least my voice and associative reasoning is suspicious because I know I’m smarter than the — wait wait, how can I possibly write this under that premise if I’m not lying?

maybe I delved deep into topics that are infuriating and this limit in cognition is due to a mental place of dissociation from that infuriating set of events that my memory is stuck in.

then does some part of me exist that is infuriated? 

And does my memory have a grammatical structure that prevents it from teleporting to a different region of memories while the rest of me seemingly does teleport to a different region of memories?

And is something else — that I’m not conscious of — sentient in those memories? 

---

The reason for this, I sense, is that some part of me seems to “know” (think) that something I wrote will be negatively judged.

I am not conscious as that part and don’t know why, in a mild-to-optimistic interpretation of people and things, what I wrote would be negatively judged. But yes, in a really severe interpretation, I know it can be negatively judged.

Somehow that possibility tortures me.

Every negative judgement would be really unfair. They would exponentially boil only into an interpretation of others as deranged, psychotic, or really unintelligent and lacking wisdom.

Honestly, it might be well earned self-pity
