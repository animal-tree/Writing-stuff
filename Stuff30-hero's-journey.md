Why don't I want to post this?

In the context of crypticism, it’s a power-move. In the context of storytelling or a description of the mechanisms of collective consciousness, as an optimistic theology about the love of higher nature, it’s good.

"I don't like the perception of it as a power move." my inner archetype representative of my advisor answers. 

Neither do I. That's why I just said: In the context of storytelling or a description of the mechanisms of collective consciousness, as an optimistic theology about the love of higher nature, it’s good.

""Maybe the spirits want me to post it? In this light and context.""

No. No they don't.
