we need proper studies of long-term effectiveness of different remedies, including ones which do not traditionally, immediately, or without-greater-contextualization, seem effective.

diet

meditation

meditation types

yogas

cold baths

sacrifices - movies, tv shows, porn, social media, internet

nature

activity

A study that combinatorially accounts for all of these at different longevities for perhaps different populations, backgrounds, and so forth.

Changing a population’s economic and other conditions, such as by starting the study with no stipend, and gradually increasing the stipend, would measure the contribution of those factors as well, among population sub-samples.

dietary changes that are surprising but convincingly effective: organic-steak-and-wild-caught-salmon-only, with salt and peppers, and maybe tea, permitted.

sacrifices that are surprising but convincingly effective, especially for eczema: meditation and no-porn.

activity that are terrible but might co-mutually make exercising willpower in other domains easier: cold baths and regular time in nature, together with jogging as/if wanted.

activity other people swear by but that I don’t get much kick out of: most yoga and choreographed-partner-dancing

[cue change of linguistic model] 

meditation-esque activity I once found really helpful, but have not been able to reproduce: isolated angry self-dancing, that is, with headphones as I kicked and punched the air in ecstatic stupid carefree joy

activity that hasn’t been tried: public well-being educational sex orgies, but literally, where no one’s in charge, of different selectable group-types, in which facilitators may be responsible for matching and re-matching people according to a process of trusting the patient, not the “doctor”
