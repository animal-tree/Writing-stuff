If you’re like me, you can never get your sleep together. I wake up early in the morning and have a million disciplines, a contradictory fact to the fact that I sleep in well past noon and regurgitate whatever words come out of my mouth. Anyway, the reason that’s possible is because time is not a single point in, uh, time. There times in my life when I had my sleep together. There were times when I didn’t. But to fix it, I used two techniques. Nothing else worked. I know all of them. Whatever. These are the two I used. Eating steak and wild salmon during the day and only the day (assuming it’s not just before I go to bed in-the-day) and walking outside, being under the sun and stars when I’m not sleeping, preferably away from artificial lights. The park, if you’ve had enough practice hiking that you feel comfortable to go alone at night. Or the beach. Or, if you are just plain-old-scared of being outside at night when you’re sleepless and need medical aid, try absinthe. Just kidding. Going outside is good for you.

But the noteworthy thing about this time dilemma, that I sat down to write… and I don’t know why my language centers and whoever-consciousness facilitating my communication keep, uh, “sabotaging” me with words I don’t necessarily mean and thoughts that stray too far… anyway. I’m saying time is roundabout like that. Day and night day and night, and eventually you’re two different people. Seems a contradiction. It’s not. It’s just the earth spinning and dancing around a big ball of helium-4. 

But as I was saying, time is like that, divisible into many parts. So is space. So is all that we know, parts composed of parts down to elementary particles — and who knows those could be little universes. We don’t know. Have we ever looked inside one? I sure haven’t! I’m not into that.

Anyway. Again. Causality has to cause itself, right? Or else where would it have… been caused by? Turtles, maybe. Turtles of causality, all the way down, forever. But another explanation is normal cyclicality. “Oh, eventually I’ll give birth to my great grandfather.” Something like that.

But another is partial cyclicality. After all, cyclicality would be scary and bad according to every religion and, I believe, philosophy that has contemplated it. Rebirth, Samsara, eternal recurrence. These are all described as tragic things. At best, terrifying.

But we can have partial cyclicality. And that’s how I fix my sleep schedule. (Sometimes! I’m never the same river twice.)

So one other way to fix your sleep schedule, if you’re waking up really late… one trick I’ve tried many times. Successfully even, I think. I don’t remember. It was college. Is to spin the cycle all the way around at that point. Just go 12 hours forward instead of 12 hours back. Easier for me, sometimes.

But one other way, and I think this is how the universe works, is to cycle parts at a time. Gradually shift into naps here and there, eventually get your whole sleep phase in order, at night, as you follow the most important steps: waking-time steak and 24/7 sun/star-shiney outdoors.

I think the universe, analogously, recycles itself piecemeal so that it doesn’t have to actually do that scary, terrible Samsara thing. Probabilistic modulations, here and there, while the rest of it stays pretty much in tact. It’s like, from time to time I create my great grandfather’s thumb.

I mean it can also have a yin-yang type one-creates-the-other back-and-forth.
