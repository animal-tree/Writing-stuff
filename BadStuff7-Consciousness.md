#### Consciousness

That the universe is conscious requires an *ad absurdum* argument.

I am conscious, therefore consciousness exists. I observe, I observe my observations, I observe my memories and perceptions, I observe my feelings and physical feelings, I observe the thought patterns, I observe my range of actions.

Let me rephrase that. I am observing that moving inward into what I am, I observe that I can observe. Moving yet deeper, I observe thoughts, feelings, memories, perceptions, and more. I am, therefore my thoughts are too.

This is somewhat backwards from René Descartes’s “I think, therefore I am.”

Nevertheless, our existence can be taken as axiom, proven by its own observed existence.

Axiom: I observe.

We then derive a set of logics and rules based on the consistent patterns of those observations, trusting our memory’s assertion of their consistency as predictive of their future consistency.

Among those predictive correlates is the presumptive fact that a flipbook is an innanimate object, or if it’s not, by some odd chance, then it’s nevertheless no radically different in terms of consciousness than another sufficiently complex symbolic object. That is, a flipbook does not stand out of its own accord as uniquely conscious or “animate”. 

The argument that consciousness is representational reduces directly to this contrary absurdity. Given a sufficiently complex diagram of the human brain and all of its neurons, within the pages of a movie-like flipbook, we would produce within its covers a human consciousness, so the representational argument goes. However, holding a physical flipbook, and really thinking, that argument would raise doubt. A pen-drawing couldn’t produce in its pages human-like consciousness, I don’t think. It might! But I don’t think pen and paper could do that.

No more so silicon and electron zips.

Therefore, the absurdity, while seeming less absurd in the context of advanced circuits, generalizes to microchips and artificial neural networks running on CPUs and GPUs and TPUs as well. Those electron zips however could be the defining factor however, not the representation, so the physical material property of the object simulating the symbolic brain function would make more sense as a causal explanation for consciousness than representation alone.

In that matter, the brain, in conjunction with the body and nervous system, being conscious, is exemplar proof — as far as the limits of observation can take us — of a matter-combination that can yield consciousness.

We may assume for the time being that human-like conciousness is a complex combination.

If it’s not representation, as by the *reductio ad absurdum* flipbook argument, then it’s matter — some substrate of the universe — or a combination of matter and representation. If it were simulated, it would require a complex representational combination. And since we have shown that representation alone reduces to *reductio ad absurdum*, it would have to have a specific material combination. A substance containing human-consciousness standalone has (1) not been discovered, and (2) and is pretty absurd without neither human-like brain nor body (or something equally complex) to define it. 

Representation is combination, the interaction of forces in the universe forming increased complexity from elementary parts, but not all combinations are of the same materials. In known physics, those materials are generally assumed to be elementary particles and varying combinations.

The question becomes: what elementary parts and interactions produce human-like consciousness? Representation alone has been shown to reduce to absurdity, assuming a human-like conscious flipbook is impossible.

Therefore it is a question of physics, pertaining to the particle behaviors in question (as well as biophysics), and chemistry, pertaining to the complex interactions (and biochemistry). 

What elementary particles and interactions then create the elementary-most form(s) of consciousness?

Perhaps the chemistry is as complex as the neuron itself.

Perhaps it’s much simpler, in the atoms themselves.

Protons? Neutrons? Zipping electrons? Or all matter and particles? In that case, perhaps a flipbook is conscious, sort of.

**Consciousness and Occam's razor**:

Given two causal explanations of effect $y$, one that depends on $a$ as cause and the other that depends on $a, b$ as cause: 

1. $\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(a, h^{(0)}) \vert y, \mathrm{R})$
2. $\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(a, b, h^{(0)}) \vert y, \mathrm{R})$

an epistemological principle can be added to disentangle causes for the sake of generality.

But why is generality a motivator for reasoning? It is a good prior for human reasoning, though only useful as a heuristic for search, not as a deduction step. However, in epistemological deduction, search is effectively what we're doing, as it's about the quantification of belief.

Fewer assumptions, until evidence is available to the contrary, is wiser.

It does not afford us to say consciousness is "only" matter. Just that it definitely is. It could be something else as well, and the assumption of-non-consciousness of flipbook could be wrong.

Does it mean more than what the flipbook assumption already tells us?

It means before we understand the representation, we should identify the matter.

Collision entanglements.

Specific ones or interpretable ones?

Yes, interpretable complexities. Or something specific to the brain.

Then what is the "feeling" that a computer feels?

Electric. Not good. Zipping-zapping, whiny, uncomfortable.

What does a rock feel?

Hard.

Can a tree feel pain?

It can feel love.

How does a flipbook feel?

Impartial and unassuming, unlike somebody.

A flipbook probably can't experience human-like consciousness, at least not induced by the drawings in it. Even drawing a sufficiently advanced representation of the brain, with all the neurons and time steps, the flipbook, probably wouldn't be conscious as the way the human was.

Then consciousness is matter, not just representation. The simplest explanation is that it's in all matter, in a primordial form that increases in complexity.

By Occam's razor, this remains the best explanation.

Since there is no elementary particle for consciousness in the standard model of physics discovered as of yet, it is most likely in the collisions between particles, and forces between them.

Entanglements that scale locally.
