$\mathrm{I}_I(\mathrm{I}_J) \rightarrow \mathrm{I_J} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_K} \rightarrow \mathrm{I}_I(\mathrm{I}_K)$ says something far more profound than Qualia. Choice.

What we have here is one more ambiguity, undefined. In the connected (or unconnected) cyclic graph, where do $\mathrm{I_J} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_K}$ for which pairs of $J, K$?

What if we make the wrong choice about what to "observe"? Should $J$ transition to $K$, say, "work", or, the next letter chronologically, $L$, love?

Obviously love.

This choice in the graph should not be determined.

We can have (a) many branching implications creating many redundant "defined" implications, all leading back to the same cyclicality, (b) non-deterministic branches (dualities), (c) non-deterministic straight-paths (just choice), or (d) deterministic straight-paths (no choice, $a \rightarrow b$, $J \rightarrow K$, chronological order, no fuss.

(b) is the most conducive to optimization.

Let's explore that in more depth.

What we're talking about is a universe with an undefined principle of choice. One of those, displays a wave-particle duality pattern of branching choices.

However, $\mathrm{I}'s$ choice patterns have to depend on something. And at the conclusion of the cyclicality trajectory, whatever that something is (spoiler: qualia) returns to its base original state. And therefore any accumulated knowledge or trajectory optimization strategies gets lost. 

There is also a second assumption:

**Axiom 2:** Some qualia feel better than others.

This is a theory about the fundamental nature of reality. $\mathbb{N}$ is the natural number set, but a very different one than the natural numbers.
