$\mathrm{I}_I(\mathrm{I}_J) \rightarrow \mathrm{I_J} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_K} \rightarrow \mathrm{I}_I(\mathrm{I}_K)$ says something far more profound than Qualia. Choice.

What we have here is one more ambiguity, undefined. In the connected (or unconnected) cyclic graph, where do $\mathrm{I_J} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_K}$ for which pairs of $J, K$?
