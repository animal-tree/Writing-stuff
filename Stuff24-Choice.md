$\mathrm{I}_I(\mathrm{I}_J) \rightarrow \mathrm{I_J} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_K} \rightarrow \mathrm{I}_I(\mathrm{I}_K)$ says something far more profound than Qualia. Choice.

What we have here is one more ambiguity, undefined. In the connected (or unconnected) cyclic graph, where do $\mathrm{I_J} \rightarrow \mathrm{I_K}$ for which pairs of $J, K$?

What if we make the wrong choice about what to "observe"? Should $J$ transition to $K$, say, "work", or, the next letter chronologically, $L$, love?

Obviously love.

This choice in the graph should not be determined.

We can have (a) many branching implications creating many redundant "defined" implications, all leading back to the same cyclicality, (b) non-deterministic branches (dualities), (c) non-deterministic straight-paths (just choice), or (d) deterministic straight-paths (no choice, $a \rightarrow b$, $J \rightarrow K$, chronological order, no fuss.

(b) is the most conducive to optimization.

Let's explore that in more depth.

What we're talking about is a universe with an undefined principle of choice. One of those, displays a wave-particle duality pattern of branching choices.

However, $\mathrm{I}'s$ choice patterns have to depend on something. And at the conclusion of the cyclicality trajectory, whatever that something is (spoiler: qualia) returns to its base original state. And therefore any accumulated knowledge or trajectory optimization strategies gets lost. 

There is also a second assumption:

**Axiom 2:** Some qualia feel better than others.

This is a theory about the fundamental nature of reality. $\mathbb{N}$ is the natural number set, but a very different one than the natural numbers.

So what limits qualia?

**Axiom 3:** $\mathbb{N}$ is finite.

$\mathbb{N}$ is finite and is bound to return to its causal state.

Does this spell doom and gloom? No, because Qualia, while dependent on qualia, is not finite...

Let us be more precise.

**Axiom 2:** Some qualia feel better than others.

We have an objective:

$K =  \max\limits_K \mathbf{P}(\mathrm{I}_L(\cdot) \vert \mathrm{I}_K)$,

where $L \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is some objectively good feeling.

For reference, Love.

This begs the question why not just select Love immediately by choice. Giving rise to

**Axiom 3:** $\mathbb{N}$ is finite.

**Theorem 2:** Qualia is constrained.

**Proof:**

By Definition 2, the Qualia implication graph must cycle. Therefore it can never "pause" in one state of being except its original state. Furthermore, it cannot ever get trapped into a sub-cycle.

Since there is a finite set of qualia by Axiom 3, Qualia must always create new qualia into infinity or die, indeed something it can do by the existing definitions and axioms. Its original state, is death, existence but without qualia. Hence a "pause" there would mean permanent death. $\square$

This causes it to, unambiguously, be constrained, giving rise to a yet-undetermined laws of physics and an optimization problem.

We thus have an expanding universe.
