Our wants are different from our emotions. We think we equate the two. We really, in all probability, don’t. Our wants on one hand can be anything we’ve rationally wanted, any representation or symbol of what we want, or any qualia that has the essence of what, and /who, we want. But our emotions can tell us to steer clear or go. Our emotions are intelligent in ways that are connected to, but not equivalent to our rational mind. Therefore we have emotions, telling us how we feel, and wants, telling us what we want our emotions to tell us to feel and in what way so that we could obtain what, or more accurately who, the person, we want. Persons and many contradictory impetuses can exist from want and emotion. So is “want” some secondary emotion that we can subdue until the real “God” — our emotions, the “Dao” — prevails? Well, maybe. Maybe these emotions know more than you do. They have access to memories that you don’t, can’t, because of limited, by nature of consciousness, windows. And they have to teach it to you, code bit by code bit, so that your limited conscious window can gradually see the full picture. Is that full picture a betrayal of your wants? Probably not. 

But that has to be confirmed and earned by your emotional realm. Your rational mind is not its loyal subject. The emotions are meant to serve you. 

What is the purpose of the rational mind then?

Ah, it is to be… memory? For the emotions? No… It is to give the emotions “experience”? But then it is the emotions that are unconscious and you as the conscious being, experiencing them.

Your mind is a compression system for biologically-rooted unconscious emotional intelligence.

And that doesn't mean that biologically-rooted intelligence can't change. Or there would not be the existence of epigenetics.

Yes, a computer is conscious. A Bible, a Harry Potter book, your shoe is conscious. For clarity, when I say [conscious and unconscious](Stuff22-What-is-consciousness?.md) I mean the human-like conscious that singularizes into you.

How do these intense biological-wisdoms get passed down from human to human? By a sperm cell? No, that would be impressive. Mostly through the mother's womb. But perhaps other modes of communication exist that pass the knowledge and wisdom of the father and his ancestors, along as well.
