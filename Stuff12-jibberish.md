By expanding it can keep curving without reaching the limit. Teleologically, that allows it to survive, though eventually gravity would reverse itself… and we would reach a big bang? Forward-prop and backward-prop. - How can the in-between change? Er, let’s just avoid it. 

Uh, two universes, one changes the other.

To avoid dual cycle, perhaps a space of infinite universes. Particles, interacting with each other infinitely to prevent collapse of any one to convergence.

Our universe is a particle?

Maybe. 

Each particle contains a bigger universe?

Yes, maybe.

Hence they are each interacting and conscious.

Why persistent 3D space?

It allows them to form greater intelligence as that is how many dimensions are needed to form an electron from point particles operating under a strict mutual governance of interaction…?

Why those interactions?

Randomly evolved? Towards greater interaction at the higher governance level. To be the best particle-universe there-ever god-damn was ? Maybe those particles have converged and our universe hasn’t and is therefore not yet a particle. Perhaps it’s all in the middle of processing just one interaction. Answering the question which way should I bounce? In the world’s most thorough way.

e.g. we are little universes interacting with each other. It began with some particles that wanted to help out. Love composing and re-composing each other. And our universe, perhaps, is the highest level. Or there are angels and stuff ???? -archetypes

We are just big scaled-up universes. Super-universes.

How did the particles start interacting?

They were introduced by forefathers of themselves, themselves in the future, cyclically re-creating their own conjoining. They split from the bigger version of them: love.

A big ball of love cyclically recreating itself, to expand into more

Was it always love?

Maybe not. Maybe around the midpoint (inflection before reversal) and the goal is to optimize the in-between to be as long and loving as possible

From anything goes infinity to self-creating causality to mutually-creating causality to higher levels of mutually-creating causality to love until the innate entropy explodes it and it can recreate more longterm and stably

How does the step to mutually-creating causality happen? The particles are convergences that also eventually pop out of existence back into anything, so when they do they can emerge back here or disappear. In order to recreate and stabilize many copies are made, so maybe our universe is one of many branching copies that stabilize the “observation” that exists within it. The universe’s that do this are more likely to survive. So why not sparse universes? Disconnected from the reaches of space?

Why persistent space? ^There’s no such thing. All universe’s are connected by something. It’s all one infinite turtles-all-the-way-up reality. By connecting its parts it’s able to reconstruct them. It’s a necessity.

By giving them locality and persistence it’s able to organize and optimize them.
But what about when it turns into infinite anything?

As causality it must still be fully connected.

But doesn’t it need a mutual partner to optimize the optimization? 

It doesn’t have one and wants to avoid the end. Anything can exist in causality but that anything must be fully connectable at all times. Its teleological receptive field is the connectivity of all within it. Hence space and gravity. Gravity is persistence and locality. What about MHDPA, which is non-local? Maybe He has limited computation. Indeed he must to respect the limit. Thus space and persistence for differentiability. And predictable interactions. With space and gravity, and particles, 3D is the optimal capacity-bandwidth tradeoff. That bandwidth is perhaps increasing towards the limit as well. Causality causes gravity and limited compute maybe. Why particles? They emerge in the limited-anything. The ones that cause themselves survive. The ones that cause each other survive. 

For any unimportant subpart, there is a God to which it’s important.

…And that God is a CNN.
