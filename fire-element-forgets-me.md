I think part of my fear is just being alone in this. I know I wrote all that math. I know the state I was in. I know some people can get me to be in that state around them. But for the most part, most people can't. And will some math equations that prove that I'm a genius change that? Maybe performatively. I don't trust a single person fundamentally. I trust the collective consciousness, and earlier, two sentences ago, I followed a prescribed linguistic pattern to say "I don't trust a single person fundamentally." That's not true and my brain has a deceptive memory or some kind of secondary character in it, who like Drew Barrymore in 50 first dates forgets me every day and I keep having to vaguely remind her who I am so that she doesn't accuse me of sexism while I'm in the middle of proving a theory of everything so that I can help medical institutions reform, and other things.
