#### Problems

The purpose of general intelligence is to make the lives of humans better. Exactly how technology affords to do this depends on the technology, and its effects can range from good to bad. Energy technologies can simulatenously raise megatons of hell on unsuspecting populations as generate near-unlimitted clean, renewable electric and thermal power. With every major technological innovation, the most important question before getting carried away with amazement at its novel capabilities, is why? Why do we need AGI? Why do we need AI? Are there alternatives to the same goals that would suit humanity better?

For example, one of my dreams is to build an autonomous fishing bot: a drone that can fly over waters, drop a line, hook, and lure, and autonomously catch fish, and deliver them back to populations in need. Of course, technology like this — which is not far off from our existing capabilities — which is almost-objectively *good technology* — must also be interrogated. Can drones so self-determining be just as readily deployed for war and militaristic devastation? Is there an equally suitable alternative for simplifying fishing and delivering food to the world hungry that wouldn't require much automation, that we can already do with our current technology? The answer to both questions is likely yes. A drone with the vision and navigation skills to adaptively catch and deliver yields of fish can easily be used for drone strikes. We as humans already have more than enough surpluses of food and wasted food production engines (entire factories making Snickers bars) to direct resources to the world hungry ten thousand times over, delivering by hand and helicopter just as easily as by self-piloting drone or self-driving delivery truck.

Do we need face recognition for quickly logging into our phones at the cost of governments using it for mass surveillance of civilians? Do we need humanoids learning to cook for us when we can, perhaps more spiritually fulfillingly, learn to do it, er, cook, ourselves?

I’ve yet to encounter an answer in my field that 100%, er, satisfied, not sure why these linguistic choices are being made. For the most part, most work today is driven by the pleasure and power economies, not the actual needs of humans suffering, not the global poor usually, not the spiritual development, satisfaction, and apotheosis of individuals. There are niche efforts targetted towards wildlife preservation, rainforest conservation, mitigating climate change, and so on. These are a minority of the actual applications. Most AI compute servers are used today for services like ad-recommendation or training ChatGPT. Most of the internet is used for porn. Most food production is inorganic, factory-based, and processed. Yet gargantuan resources go into driving these economies of pleasure and power.

And even when there is an answer to “Why?”, it’s usually myopic or remedial. Snicker bars “make people happy!” is a myopic justification for the incredible waste that goes into producing surplus foods in the most obese nation on Earth that *make people happy* while children elsewhere beg in the streets and die of hunger. Or remedial: bandaids on problems that don’t need to exist in the first place. AI forest-fire surveillance technologies can help reduce the increased risk of forest fires caused by climate change, but our simultaneous guilt as a species is that climate change is a man-made problem in the first place. 

When my grandma was sick, the doctors would always prescribe new drugs. At one point, she was taking maybe 12 different prescriptions multiple times a day. And every time one pill caused a new side effect, another one was added to the mix. My feelings on medical practices aside, the tendency of mankind to treat symptoms and side effects with more rather than less/different remedies extends to every technology. Whatever the original problems of man were — weather extremes, food, wild predators — they have now evolved into a million fragmented and fractured problems, all of them more specific and myopic and unique to humans than the next. Meanwhile, we have more than enough technologically to solve all of the original problems our species faced, or at least the most fundamental human basics, and somehow, for a large proportion of the population, especially but not exclusively the global poor, we still haven’t. Heck, even access to clean water is something much of the global poor can’t afford, arguably a step *backward* from the river-valley civilizations of ancient times, despite all, of, the years of supposed-progress.

The three items, that can largely be conceptualized independent, or as axiomatic problems, were:

1. Weather extremes
2. Food
3. Wild predators

One more item:

4. Disease

This one requires its own focus because the threat of disease is not even slightly independent to the threats of the other three. Therefore this item is not axiomatic, but deductive, entangled causally with those 3 factors and others. Extreme cold or heat (1), pollution (1), dryness or drought (1), bad or poisonous foods (2), and bacterial and viral “wild predators" at the microscopic scale (3) are major causes of disease.

While alopathy battles the microscopic predators already at war within/with the biome of the body, exercise, good diet, plenty of time in nature, good social systems are like a stakewall. The pharmaceutical industry gets far more money though (and bigger total land grants, and more employees) than the national parks services.

In my belief, disease could be seriously mitigated if people were afforded healthier social and economic structures, good food, and deeper connection with un-polluted nature. Due to the entanglement of this factor with so many other factors, it’s hard to say what actually is axiomatic and what never-before-tried combinations of changes (social, economic, dietary, and so forth) would be considered sufficient for humanity global health. It’s also impossible to define where that line would be. Would a long, healthy, happy life for everyone be the finish-marker? Or must we cure death altogether? These questions cannot be addressed in this thesis.
