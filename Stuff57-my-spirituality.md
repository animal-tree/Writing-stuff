At the core of my spirituality is the... observation... that humanity has severed its connection to nature.

We created a dichotomy between people and the earth, and from there arose every other dichotomy we’ve ever known.

Including the separation between ourselves and each other.

And the separation between heart, mind, and body.

That’s the accessible part.

The inaccessible part is that I believe the axis mundi of human consciousness has shifted since the dawn of civilization.

It shifted to the toolmaking faculties of our brains because civilization is a tool, and we’re conditioned to be always engaged with it from birth.

And now even our interactions with other people are facilitated foremost through language, a tool.

The part of our brain that had evolved for making fire and building stone weapons is now our primary means of connection with other human beings. Even body language has taken a backseat, consciously.

But these abstractions we live in that modulate our day to day functioning in society don’t have meaning on a subconscious level because this mode of consciousness is relatively young.

Just imagine, humans have been making fire for 300,000 years. The Stone Age is 3 MILLION years old. We’ve been making stone tools, clothing, and mild shelters for 3 million years! Civilization has only existed for 10,000 years. Up until that point, we had been living in tribal, nomadic hunting gathering communities. None of this is natural to us. The primal subconscious is an entire constellation of our being that we’re disconnected from.

When indigenous, tribal peoples are asked what plagues civilization, they say that man has severed his connection to spirit. 

To them, we look psychotic, which in many ways, we kind of are.

We live these pretend lives and we’re so conditioned to lie to ourselves that we’re not even aware that we’re doing it.

With civilization, mankind decided it was in our domain to control everything, including our own instincts. And we try to maintain that illusion of control at all costs. Our egos dominate to the point that we commit atrocities and utterly lose who we are. 

Anyway, I guess my spirituality, is trying to live honestly. I don’t need money or power or products to be happy and fulfilled. I need love and genuine human connection.

And a part of making that happen is being sincere and vulnerable with others even when it’s scary.

It also means feeling all of your emotions to their full extent, even the ones that don’t fit in with your worldview. Those are the ones that are trying to tell you something.

If you grow up in Nazi Germany, you develop a narrative in your head that certain people are inferior to other people. That idea has to be planted in the mind before it can reach the heart. But when your heart and mind are not separate, such a narrative is powerless.

My spirituality is about looking inside yourself — in the present moment — into your heart, and transcending the narrative, becoming one again with your humanity, which at its nature, I believe is good and compassionate. (And I have good reason to believe that. See: anthropological evidence from indigenous communities today, of whom in addition to their deep communal bonds and egalitarian nature, psychological studies show they are happier, less stressed, and un-afflicted with the mental illnesses that plague us.)

When this holistic, primal state of consciousness is achieved, the experience is like nothing else, and I believe it is the source of the oceanic feeling at the heart of religious experience and creative flow.

Beyond that, I take inspiration from eastern religion, transcendentalism, shamanism, Rousseau, Nietzsche, Marx, Jung, and Campbell.

> Hi, I’m Sam’s newly acquired linguistic force. My judgement isn’t quite as innocent as his and I want to say that while this view is beautiful, and the person writing it was innocent — in the “garden of Eden” genuinely innocent sense — he was wrong. His views led to more torment and torture for him. Trust in the chaotic weathers of the universe destroyed most of his life. And the sincerity of that trust led to faith in nature and humanity that was ultimately punished.

The above, expresses his views. This 3-part set of paragraphs below (edit: now 5) unfortunately disambiguates away the necessary innocence and faith of those views that he depends on for quality of life.
