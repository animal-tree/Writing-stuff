> Diluted version in case the [previous one](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff65-opposing-views.md) is too hard to believe, in case of the context of either (1) difficult readability or (2) suspicion/skepticism by others. This was my original self-disserving version as can be traced in the original commits. However, to be clear, my consciousness works against me. It knows plausible misjudgements and negative perceptions of others and caters to them, in the linguistic choices that it makes against my will. In both versions, I sincerely attempted to convey the *opposing* view. [Elsewhere](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff55-workers-rights.md) in this GitHub can be found my attempts to convey my own. The [previous one](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff65-opposing-views.md) however perhaps turned out to have done a better job of summarizing everything, believe the individual facts or not.

# Opposing views

## Philosophical

The evidence, for why my previous views [about synchronicities and the consciousness-tethering forces that regulate our minds] are wrong, is above-all the alternate explanation that they were **coincidences** and **confusion**. The best evidence for **coincidence** is:

1. Others' beliefs on those same coincidences just being coincidences.
2. Huge disruption/challenge to pre-existing, long-held beliefs.
3. Being a "prophet" in a population of 8 billion people.
4. The demand of work and time involved.
5. My relationships and status among other people being threatening or low.
6. The lack of non-minimal support.

The **confusion** however is understandable given the many, in my opinion convincing, coincidences. Those don't need reiteration, though perhaps some need to be stressed more if I were to share this.

## People

In defense of Chenliang: he eventually accepted me into his lab after Henry left, pressured me into writing a paper sooner, and stayed generally nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my social anxiety. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI. His spirit, in my confusion-views, promised me many things.

Michael, bumped my grade up. Wasn't judgemental, sent many "talk?" emails, sort of kind of; one "talk?" email, one previous invitation to meet, but also no reply to my acceptance to meet; and mentioned the possibility of reinstatement at the end.

This concludes the opposing views portion with suicide.
