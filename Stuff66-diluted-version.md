> Diluted version in case the previous one was too hard to believe, in case of the context of your own inability to read:

The evidence, for why my previous views [about synchronicities and the consciousness-tethering forces that regulate our minds] are wrong, is above-all the alternate explanation that they were **coincidences** and **confusion**. The best evidence for **coincidence** is:

1. Others' beliefs on those same coincidences just being coincidences.
2. Huge disruption/challenge to pre-existing, long-held beliefs.
3. Being a "prophet" in a population of 8 billion people.
4. The demand of work and time involved.
5. My relationships and status among other people being threatening or low.
6. The lack of non-minimal support.

The **confusion** however is understandable given the many, in my opinion convincing, coincidences. Those don't need reiteration, though perhaps some need to be stressed more if I were to share this.

In defense of Chenliang: he picked me up after Henry left, pressured me into writing a paper, and stayed generally nice throughout the time, while not expressing judgement towards my shortcomings until the last end. He sometimes had a good understanding of AI. His spirit, in my insanity-views, promised me many things.

Michael, bumped my grade up. Wasn't judgemental, sent many "talk?" emails, sort of kind of; one "talk?" email, one previous invitation to meet, but also no reply to my acceptance to meet; and mentioned the possibility of reinstatement at the end.

This concludes the opposing views portion with suicide.
