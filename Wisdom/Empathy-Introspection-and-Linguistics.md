But you know, understanding another’s point of view, figuring out what it is, reframing it in the way that meets your best interpretation of them and of their principles, consistent with yourself and your own, is empathy, a good practice, and somehow I somehow unlearned in part. 

Counterpoint: emotional energy. There’s such a thing as being too nice, or even imposing, accidentally. 

To prevent that, a balance of both may be possible to learn, where one directs their will and emotional energy toward the known objective coherent with one’s principles. 

And the development of principles. 

Also, note, if you thought there was a grammatical typo in “somehow I somehow”, think again, because I did on second reading and realized, no, that grammar and semantics actually works. The how that something is unlearned has a how as well, called epistemology, something I learned through the study of learning, AI.

*that grammar and THOSE semantics

Ah shit, I swear to you I’m not shouting! Oh no don’t leave me! No no!!!! 😫

I can’t read the original grammatical correctness anymore. Every time I read it, I can only see grammatical error. Am I gaslighting or was I wrong the second time about being wrong about being wrong?

I meant: “somehow I somehow unlearned that practice in part.“
