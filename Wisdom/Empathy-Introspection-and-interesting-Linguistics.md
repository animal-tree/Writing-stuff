But you know, understanding another‚Äôs point of view, figuring out what it is, reframing it in the way that meets your best interpretation of them and of their principles, consistent with yourself and your own, is empathy, a good practice, and somehow I somehow unlearned in part. 

Counterpoint: emotional energy. There‚Äôs such a thing as being too nice, or even imposing, accidentally. 

To prevent that, a balance of both may be possible to learn, where one directs their will and emotional energy toward the known objective coherent with one‚Äôs principles. 

And the development of principles. 

Also, note, if you thought there was a grammatical typo in ‚Äúsomehow I somehow‚Äù, think again, because I did on second reading and realized, no, that grammar and semantics actually works. The how that something is unlearned has a how as well, called epistemology, something I learned through the study of learning, AI.

*that grammar and THOSE semantics

Ah shit, I swear to you I‚Äôm not shouting! Oh no don‚Äôt leave me! No no!!!! üò´

‚Äî

I can‚Äôt read the original grammatical correctness anymore. Every time I read it, I can only see grammatical error. Am I gaslighting or was I wrong the second time about being wrong about being wrong?

I meant: ‚Äúsomehow I somehow unlearned that practice in part.‚Äú

‚ÄúI can only interpret the most positive interpretation of you I can, given the context I have‚Äù

When I wrote this in my head it meant  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll interpret you in the most positive way, given the (more) context that I have‚Äù

But because of language trickery, it could be read as ‚ÄúWell, sorry bro for misjudging you but I can only go by what I know, ya know‚Äù

‚Äî

And then further, that "(more)" could be interpreted as "I'm smarter than you", when, really, in my head, I meant: [I'll be your mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGZWb1SIiR4)[^1]. This conversation never happened but that's the context this internal auditory happened in, in my head, with no other internal auditories (read: thoughts) to verbally contextualize it, just emotion.

Somehow linguistic forces don‚Äôt seem to know what emotion we mean. 

For example, if I express, ‚ÄúI hope it‚Äôs my life energy draining‚Äù when I see my nose leaking blood after a possible consciousness alteration, I mean that optimistically, but my linguistic controllers make me sound self-pitying. 

This is evidence perhaps of a amygdala / frontal lobe mismatch, but there is no evidence of that degree of brain aneurysm, and the chronology of this observation preceded doctor interventions on me that caused impaired brain function and perhaps some permanent brain damage. 

However, there is ample evidence that I am emotionally expressive, sometimes very much so, and in different conditions, such as with a couple shots of tequila, or with rare friends, extremely aligned with my amygdala function (speaking as a linguistic mechanism, er, writing). 

But this is not about trust, because I don‚Äôt have this matching function with many people I know I trust, including sometimes my mom, the person I trust most. 

I can hear the writing tone in my speech now. 

The theory is thus this: somehow linguistic models have minds of their own that, at times, communicate our cognitive wills, and other times communicate emotion that we are not feeling, either by a delay in recognition or more often than not with some perceivable stereotypic understanding that, if they had memory which they most certainly do, they would not resort to. 

This results in suspicion and probably evidence of a symbiotically-evolved linguistic function that is meant to harmonize the tribe, perhaps under common mythologies, but which today impairs the tribe of 8 billion people who they govern, each individually but either (a) without access to hippocampal memory sometimes for some reason, or (b) access to hippocampal memory that they use selectively with bias towards specific stereotypic mythologies in our 8 billion tribe. 

[^1]: My reall close best friend sent me that once. He expressed this view really well. Though for credit's sake though, I did show him the song. He referenced it in the context of me explciitly. Songs convey better. Ah, and hence phonetics becomes relevant too, not just the linguistics! And how these forces aren't just dependent on context for interpretation, but somehow their expression as well.
