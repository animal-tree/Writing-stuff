But you know, understanding another’s point of view, figuring out what it is, reframing it in the way that meets your best interpretation of them and of their principles, consistent with yourself and your own, and pretty importantly truth, is empathy, a good practice, and somehow I somehow unlearned in part. 

Counterpoint: emotional energy. There’s such a thing as being too nice, or even imposing, accidentally. 

To prevent that, a balance of both may be possible to learn, where one directs their will and emotional energy toward the known objective coherent with one’s principles. Or incoherent, if learning is impossible.

And the development of principles. 

Also, note, if you thought there was a grammatical typo in “somehow I somehow”, think again, because I did on second reading and realized, no, that grammar and semantics actually works. The how that something is unlearned has a how as well, called epistemology, something I learned through the study of learning, AI. That's not a dick pic. I'm trying to be smart.

*that grammar and THOSE semantics

Ah shit, I swear to you I’m not shouting! Oh no don’t leave me! No no!!!! 😫

I can’t read the original grammatical correctness anymore. Every time I read it, I can only see grammatical error. Am I gaslighting or was I wrong the second time about being wrong about being wrong?

I meant: “somehow I somehow unlearned that practice in part.“

“I can only interpret the most positive interpretation of you I can, given the context I have”

When I wrote this in my head it meant  “I’ll interpret you in the most positive way, given the (more) context that I have”

But because of language trickery, it could be read as “Well, sorry bro for misjudging you but I can only go by what I know, ya know”

And then further, that "(more)" could be interpreted as "I'm smarter than you", when, really, in my head, I meant: [I'll be your mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGZWb1SIiR4). This conversation never happened but that's the context this internal auditory happened in, in my head, with no other internal auditories (read: thoughts) to verbally contextualize it, just emotion.
