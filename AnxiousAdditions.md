By defining philosophy as a random variable set, we permit the question, "What is a random variable?" even as the set is defined as one of all random variables. Random variables include probability distributions, but what else might they include? That philosophical question remains a part of this recursive set non-definition.

Is the Schrödinger wave equation for example a random variable? Yes, it can be expressed as one.

What about art? It can be. A generator in a GAN is evidence and the mechanical properties of the brain suggest that it is.

What about consciousness? Ah, that's where no other math or language except philosophy can broach! And indeed the only way to do it is from the lens of belief and probability. This question itself can be expressed as: $P(c \in \Omega)$.

Do you agree that a drawing in a flipbook couldn't make the flipbook conscious as a human would be?

Most likely, yes.

Suppose you draw a biological brain in the pages of a big flipbook, its surface and depth perspectives with upmost precision, at time step $1$ on page $1$, time step $2$ on page $2$, up to time step $t$.

If consciousness is representation $c = r$, then that book is conscious. The absurdity of paper and pen producing human-like consciousness makes it a less likely hypothesis.

There's a known laws of physics $R$ s.t.:

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y)$

and causal hypotheses for consciousness that it's stemming from matter $m$ and/or representation $r$:

1. $\mathbf{P}((c, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert c, \mathrm{R}), m \sim x$
2. $\mathbf{P}((c, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert c, \mathrm{R}), r \sim x$
3. $\mathbf{P}((c, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert c, \mathrm{R}), (m, r) \sim x$

We have shown, by the belief established thus far, that $P2 < P1$ and $P2 < P3$.

This leaves us with two competing leading suspicions: $m \sim x$ and $(m, r) \sim x$.

Now we turn to the dynamics model $R$. We know that in the existing laws of physics, there is no known mechanism for how representation, even combined with matter, would give rise to consciousness. 

However, there is an alternate explanation for how the biological intelligences of consciousness could emerge, namely that its matter — specific matter — within the brain, whose "representational" collisions and interactions, create the experience of consciousness. Not as representations but as specific chemical effects on that matter. 

However, in chemistry there is no known mechanism for how matter could interact to produce consciousness. Therefore, we could propose one more alternate hypothesis that does not alter the dynamics of $R$: that matter is consciousness generally. That there is an equivalence between matter $m$ and consciousness $c$ ($c = m$), and its forces of interaction allow us to experience greater and richer forms of that sensation. 

Unlike $(m, r) \sim x$, this causal explanation of consciousness as matter does not add an axiom to the known dynamics of assumed $R$, but rather an equivalence relation. For the time being, it remains the simplest explanation for an unknown phenomenon, not contradicted or shown improbable.

By Occam's razor, that makes it reasonable as a leading hypothesis.
