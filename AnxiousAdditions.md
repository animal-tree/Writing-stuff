Within causality there are three ways to explain the origin of something.

1. "Turtles-all-the-way-down"
2. Cyclicality
3. Magic

By defining philosophy as a random variable set, we permit the question, "What is a random variable?" even as the set is defined as one of all random variables. Random variables include probability distributions, but what else might they include? That philosophical question remains a part of this recursive set non-definition.

Is the Schrödinger wave equation for example a random variable? Yes, it can be expressed as one.

What about art? It can be. A generator in a GAN is evidence and the mechanical properties of the brain suggest that it is.

What about consciousness? Ah, that's where no other math or language except philosophy can broach! And indeed the only way to do it is from the lens of belief and probability. This question itself can be expressed as: $P(c \in \Omega)$.

TODO:

[Deduction is the axiom of every proof. Therefore, if it is false, then every proof ever in all of human history is false. We will not assume it an axiom, but instead try to prove it. Reality is true by definition. Therefore, if we can draw an equivalence between reality and deduction, then we have shown deduction to be true. An approximate equivalence would suffice in light of the fact that all natural science is based on physical evidence. If this equivalence holds, then we may treat deduction as a theorem, not as an axiom, in which case we have unaxiomatically deduced — caused — ourselves, the proof that is doing the deduction. We have emerged it into reality.

The truth value of something arising from nothing then becomes true, with that something being reality, and that causal process being deduction, answering the mystery "how can something arise from nothing?". As long as we don't make any axiomatic assumptions, then within the bounds of proof, we have mathematically shown reality's origin and derivation.

But to do so, we are using the rules of deduction, because like every proof, we are allowed to. It is the observable system that we are in. We are depending on definitions alone and not any axioms. ]I'm not convinced. Just say it's an analogy.

Or assume deduction as an axiom. Prove that assumption by the world's strongest arguments (if I'm wrong, all of human history's mathematical proofs are wrong). Distinguish definition from axiom from theorem. Something is a proof if it follows the rules of deduction. But we are using it as an axiom. Then show that physical reality emerges from that axiom, and say "this physical model is premised on the world's strongest axiom."

Okay.

We can also give each Qualia a context window:

$\emptyset = \mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_i})(\mathrm{I_i}(\mathrm{I_i})(\emptyset)))) \cup \mathrm{I_j}(\mathrm{I_j}(\mathrm{I_j}(\mathrm{I_j})(\mathrm{I_j}(\mathrm{I_j})(\emptyset))))$ = (011, 011)

Due to the existence of observation, as an axiom, these representations exist.

Since observation is the only thing that's ever been proven, let's start with it as an axiom. Representing the Identity function with various forms of observation $\mathrm{I_i}$. By mathematical law, these equations functionally hold. By Qualia, they are given reality.

Since we are proving, our implicit assumption, premised on the validity of every other proof in human history, is deduction. That is axiom 2. But what if we instead look at a consequence of deduction, and see if it can prove, deductively, deduction? Then our axiom is something other than deduction, while our process is, by definition not axiom, a deduction. We have then shown that our axiom was true and therefore also deduced deduction. Then, supposing deduction to be true, we would have as immediate consequence that our axiom was true. Either direction proves the other. Thus deduction by its own consequence and definition can be proven. Analogous to $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow X$ proving $X = Y$. 

In order to do this, we have to assume Qualia to distinguish $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow X$ from $X = Y$.
