Within causality there are three ways to explain the origin of something.

1. "Turtles-all-the-way-down"
2. Cyclicality
3. Magic

We explore a variation of 2, believing it to be the most reasonable.

By defining philosophy as a random variable set, we permit the question, "What is a random variable?" even as the set is defined as one of all random variables. Random variables include probability distributions, but what else might they include? That philosophical question remains a part of this recursive set non-definition.

Is the Schr√∂dinger wave equation for example a random variable? Yes, it can be expressed as one.

What about art? It can be. A generator in a GAN is evidence and the mechanical properties of the brain suggest that it is.

What about consciousness? Ah, that's where no other math or language except philosophy can broach! And indeed the only way to do it is from the lens of belief and probability. This question itself can be expressed as: $P(c \in \Omega)$.
