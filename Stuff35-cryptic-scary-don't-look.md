Let's define an existence function, let's call it an "observer", it's just the Identity function:

$\mathrm{I}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$

means $\exists \emptyset$.

From this, and Qualia, we'll derive the universe.

---

For reasons that will become clear later, we will define $\mathrm{I}$ as an observer and $\mathrm{I}(\cdot)$, the application of $\mathrm{I}$, as an observation. $\mathrm{I}$ is also the existence function: $(\mathrm{I}(A)) = (\exists A)$. This is appended to our Definition 1 as follows:

**Definition 1.** $( \text{Axiom } A) = (\exists A) = (\mathrm{I}(A))$.

We posit, hypothetically, it exists, as observation is the only way we know anything exists; that, and memory.

**Theorem 1.** Observation $\mathrm{I}(\cdot)$ exists, $\exists \mathrm{I}$, or $(\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{I})) = (\exists \mathrm{I})$.

**Proof.** "I observe." $\square$

That does not mean it exists in tandem with "nothing" $\emptyset$ or that it exists at the origin of the universe prior to the emergence of complex biological life. Nevertheless, we will posit it as an axiom.

**Axiom 1.** $\exists \mathrm{I}, \mathrm{I}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$ .

To be safe.

What more? $\mathrm{I_\mathit{1}} = \mathrm{I_\mathit{2}} = \cdots$ also exist, but we'll get to that later.

**Definition 6.** $\emptyset = \emptyset_K \vert \forall K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, where $K$ is called "qualia" — expressly lowercase — $\mathbb{N}$ are natural numbers — but not necessarily the natural numbers or infinite — and the set of all nothings will be called $\emptyset^\mathbb{N}$.

**Definition 7.** The universe $\Omega^{(n)}$ at deductive step $n$ is $\Omega^{(n)} \subseteq \emptyset^\mathbb{N}$ s.t. $\mathrm{I}(\Omega^{(n)}) = \Omega^{(n)}$.

The exact relationship between $\emptyset_I, \emptyset_J \in \emptyset^{\mathbb{N}}$ is undefined by the given definition of equivalence (Definition 3).

For example

$\mathrm{I}(\emptyset_I) = \emptyset_I = \emptyset_J = \mathrm{I}(\emptyset_J)$,

however, this does not necessarily imply

$\mathrm{I}(\emptyset_I) \leftrightarrow \emptyset_I \leftrightarrow \emptyset_J \leftrightarrow \mathrm{I}(\emptyset_J)$,

in one deductive step. We can unfold this for example as follows:

$\mathrm{I}(\emptyset_I) \rightarrow \emptyset_I \rightarrow \emptyset_J \rightarrow \mathrm{I}(\emptyset_J) \rightarrow \emptyset_J \rightarrow \emptyset_I \rightarrow \mathrm{I}(\emptyset_I)$.

This cycle is one of many possible deductive orderings and node-graphs that could be constructed from these equivalent nothings to satisfy the definition of equivalence in Definition 3 of our proof.

In the above example, we have a universe that survives a duration of $6$ deductive steps before collapsing on itself, making only two "distinguishable" observations/existences in the process.

It is important to note that in such cyclic graphs, and in general in our more flexible formulations later, qualia are distinguishable in the domain of the function that defines their corresponding nothing's existence.

Thus, we have created multiplexity — something — from nothing. $\square$

In my initial thoughts, I thought perhaps the cyclicality of the earlier example was a necessary property of the deductive universe within a mathematical equivalence. This thought paralleled many suspicions about the cosmogenic origin of the universe as cyclical. In my opinion, cyclicality was more elegant than the alternative, "turtles-all-the-way-down" or infinite recursion of universes creating universes. It has parallels to karmic birth/rebirth, the wheel of time, the Hindu Samsara cycle. And, expressing how horrifying such a conception of the universe would be in Western thought, Nietzsche's "eternal recurrence."

But none of these seemed 100% necessary to the definition of cyclicality. I imagined maybe instead of

$\Omega^{(n)} = \Omega^{(0)}$

at some cosmic horrible end-point/restart $N$, we could optimistically define an infinitum

$\lim_{n \to \infty} \Omega^{(n)} = \Omega^{(0)}$.

This would be one way to avoid cosmic death/restart.

However, in these slightly vaguer rules of equivalence and deduction, actually, there is a much simpler, much more flexible way to achieve causal explainability via equivalence without relying on cycles.

---

Modified Definition 5 lets us gaurentee that all objects of existence contained within equivalence may return to the origin and vice versa to satisfy the implicative cycle, without any cyclicality.

**Definition 5.** $0 \leq \mathbf{P}(A \rightarrow_n B) \leq 1$  may be non-deterministic. With some low probability $\epsilon$, we can define that any node *can* transition to any other node, eventually.

Thus our earlier cycle can be fulfilled as long as the deductive chain, analogous to the earlier conception, keeps expanding into the infinitum.

Non-determinism means all parts can "teleport" into being all other parts, not necessarily at the same time and not necessarily in any negligible or non-negligible way. But eventually, the equivalence relationship, defined in mathematics (our mathematics) is satisfied, due to infinitely small modulations.
