The brain is a better analogy for the cosmic spiritual essence of the universe that ties all of us together than the ocean. Many devotees (of unspecified new-age belief $X$) say that we are like waves within a cosmic ocean, all one, all part of something bigger, unified. But really, we are like neurons, independent and locally divided, but together, somehow, in the superconscious beyond our conscious, coming together to form a singularized intelligence, barely coordinating itself.

Unfortunately, and I say this somewhat tongue-in-cheek, we are neurons in a neural network that is hemorrhaged, sick with tumor, and demented. But the brain that connects us is desperately trying to heal the divides that torment Him or Her or Them, or however you want to call our shared cosmic Good.

The constancy of light *in vacuo* across reference frames taught us the tolerance of the weird and bizarre. The principle of relativity taught us the essentialness of equality: my physics are your physics; your physics are my physics.

These ideas were necessary for us to integrate, socially and scientifically, but the implied physics model and what we learned from these postulates cannot be the complete picture. There is something else, in my opinion, beyond what physics knows, that is intelligent and alive. Something more absolute, and even weirder than what we previously thought or would've had the palate for. So, take this idea, described below, with some open-mindedness and maybe some vegetables to help the comedown from these last 3 paragraphs.

In this work, I propose a new profession called relational healing.

Relational healers are social workers for the relational therapy between individuals in the general populace. They work to remedy and mediate separations and general gulfs between people, not as an infringement on those people, but as deeply empathetic and spiritual intermediaries/messengers/empaths, as a kind of systematized shaman. There are 8 billion human neurons in our collective tribal modern brain, and each of them connectable if not by themselves individually then by these intermediaries whose work, unlike that of a therapist, is to heal the brain relationally rather than just individually, recognizing that isolating a brain region *entirely* from another brain region, especially where communication is needed and sought, is a hemorrhage.

In contrast to relational healing, a psychiatrist might coerce a patient into a prescription of a certain set of chemicals and act exclusively but ineffectively on that one individual and not the social condition. This action repeatedly damaged me neurologically, physiologically, and made my life worse in every measurable and psychological way. Therapists are also limited in social regards/capacities, which are the most important to society's mental health. 

Existing medical practitioners often cite “helping people” as their motivation for seeking their work. However, while nurses and doctors can help in compliance with hospital rules, obediences, and practices, it is observably true that oftentimes this does not translate into actual help. One of the most effective ways to help people is to be there for your friends: to help them move, to support them after breakups, to be caring and helpful directly to the people in your life and in your social circumstances. It is the microcosmic shamanic role. But no such role exists at systematized levels, and the obligatory or obedience-based nature of existing “help” professions undermines the truthfulness of their help on the social condition. Furthermore, the existing metrics of help are, for example, “how many patients you transferred rooms”, “how many patients you injected”, “how many prescriptions did you make sure were consumed”, and not “how much love did I create.” Seeing the creation of love is and should be the metric for evaluating a professional’s help to other people.

Relational healing can do that. Individual-centric therapy barely can sometimes maybe, but really can't. It's not infringement. And not exactly clinical. Relational healing is spiritual healing. Relational healing, facilitated by those empaths who understand the spiritual principles and the psychic dimensions between people, is the systematizing of the highest wisdom in the human tribe: the shaman. Relationship processes are spiritual processes. Every myth, story, and spiritual journey has consciously or not been a relational journey. The human psyche is composed of relationship memory.

Here are some policies, since the job of a relational healer permits them to communicate to people and between people who might not want to be communicated with or about, or have privacy concerns. There is no punitive consequence for ignoring a relational healer, but relational healers have authority to try to reach you in person or by pen-letter, with extreme training/background/wisdom to do so caringly and wisely, with the following guidelines proposed that I think are reasonable to make them effective as actual healers in the social spheres, to heal the roots of the traumas, agonies, and necessities of all of our divided but singular psyche.

There are certain things that do not require approval to relay back from a relational healer mediation, such as: what was told about you by the relational healer to the other person, and more details on this and other restrictions follow below, though unfortunately pork barreled (by psychological intervening forces in the healing shaman’s mind) in the early paragraphs despite the really good expression that is at the heart of this, but this paragraph or the ones that follow, due to pork barrel crypticism, have ruined it. 

Relational healers don’t send letters or notices or warnings, unless one is chosen who explicitly operates that way, via pen letters for example. **Never formal letters or notices or warnings**, just direct or wise communication depending on the healer. They are constrained (by themselves, as per the nuanced process of how they are chosen) to being personal and loving. They can only communicate back to individuals they are mediating what is tacitly or explicitly approved, but not anything tacitly or explicitly objected to, with relational healers generally assuming a desire for privacy. It’s up to individuals to vary tacitness vs. explicitness about what can, should, or can’t be communicated, e.g. a formal text can be sent to the relational healer or to some stock record that the relational healer is notified by. However, an individual has full right to know what is communicated about them to the other person by the relational healer, even if the other person doesn’t want them to know that it was communicated. An individual also has the right to know if a message was communicated at all or rejected altogether (yes/no), since individuals can reject to hear from relational healers altogether without punitive consequence but relational healers are also given extreme leeway about communicating such as arriving at door of individual or sending pen-letter to address of individual. If an individual can’t be reached at all by multiple relational healers, one after another, then their friends, neighbors, and families can be reached out to by a relational healer, under the same restrictions. Relational healers explicitly have no power and do not have authority to testify (for the most part), judge, condemn, or punish — at least *against* any of the people they are mediating on or mediated. Their degree of freedom of operation is about the same as a police officer but without any punishment, legal/court, or formal authority. They can however come to your house. 

They also can (meaning "not prohibited"), with consent, have all the authority of a friend, and can be normal friends, and even can have romantic or sexual relationships with individuals they’re in contact with or were mediating (the past tense "were" depends on the evolution of both the society and the relational healing wisdom), but if this causes issues, then relational healers must mitigate those issues before their status as relational healer can be restored, and this can involve judicial and formal processes, meaning “innocent until proven guilty” is also a requirement, before, during, and after one’s status as a relational healer is revoked. In the interim, they cannot mediate while their status is in question and can’t practice, though remain to have whatever resources and permissions they had before non-punitively, since becoming a relational healer must have a process that gives them a huge benefit of the doubt. For example, a long period of asceticisms. Potentially monastic/nature living. Yoga, meditation. Training. etc. Methods of certifying relational healers need to be studied and investigated and trialed, in smaller consenting population samples. The monastic counsels overseeing the relational healer must inform mediated parties of the nature of any experimental practices. Relational healers may be chosen and replaced by the individuals communicating via them.

Relational healers can’t be anyone, and it requires extreme evidence, through systems of determining that don’t yet exist, to determine if somebody is or might be a relational healer, or finding ones who might likely be candidates. Aforementioned asceticisms and disciplines being a good example, but not exclusive, because many empaths might not know that they have the potential to be a formal relational healer.  Relational healers are also always looking to redesign and improve society, including these processes. But, since they aren’t necessarily police officers or legal judges, though there are no prohibitions against it, assuming the same restrictions as exist for those positions by law anyway, their power is limited depending on their individual social positions, and relational healers who amass material power, given that their healing status gave them no material advantage and probably a huge disadvantage, are extremely valuable to society, but their status as such can still be revoked as subject to the earlier described processes. I'm sensing some pork barrel in this sentence, but what it means is that relational healers can also work in other professions, and this is actually a value to society, not a disadvantage, but the criteria for both (or however many) professions must still be met, e.g. the asceticisms, monastic/wilderness/mountain living, etc., though potentially considerations and accommodations to the possible advantages of one integrating all of these perspectives at once. Relational healing systems should be designed so as to not let powerful figures abuse their power or vice versa to become relational healers. To reiterate: Relational healers explicitly have no power and do not have authority to testify (for the most part), judge, condemn, or punish — at least against any of the people they are mediating on or mediated. 

Now, if somebody doesn’t want anything about themselves communicated to somebody else, the relational healer must respect that unequivocally, except, potentially, to a limited-maximum number of other relational healers, who can help the situation potentially in their own ways. And individuals can communicate with as many relational healers as they need or want, making the job demand for such a role pretty high and the human supply — ideally empaths, and people gifted with abnormal emotional, social, and rational intelligence — really low. As more jobs become automated by AI, and more of human life becomes spiritual — that is, guided by the freedom boom of oneself — these healers will be essential and must be respected, treated well, and well paid if money still exists, like the traveling Brahmins of India ancient, which, granted, I don’t know much about. 

Rejecting to hear from multiple relational healers in a single mediation should be considered a disgrace by cultural understanding, but not by explicit law, nor something that is communicated or broadcasted to anyone by those relational healers. Relational healers, however, should never cast blame, even for this, and should always seek to "hero-ize" everyone rather than villainize, with the goal of universal peace. Relational healers can be notified that one would like to not be bothered for a certain pause period of their choosing, allowing for 3D total isolation from the other person. In 4D however, that is, spacetime, all individuals must be eventually connectable, if either wishes to be, and so the pause period requested then must be finite in time duration (the alluded 4th dimension) and processed according to the severity of the situation by the relational healers, e.g. if a client is suicidal.

What happens when a healing shaman believes the relational healing system is wrong? A process for that might exist among both relational healers and the public, whose anecdotal reports have as much weight to the consideration of reform as do the formal ones offered by the healing shaman. The "healing shaman" is the term for the relational healer who accuses the relational healing system, a term that is given enormous respect and can be claimed by anyone for as long as they hold the stance of their evidence against the relational healing system, and if they are proven or  sufficiently evidenced as right, the relational healing system must quickly reform and that relational healer may still be referred to as a "healing shaman" even after the reforms.

What happens when a healing shaman needs relational healing, but believes the relational healing system is wrong? In this case, something extraordinary. I don't know what. A general policy is relational healers should be motivated in their training to prioritize "the one over the million" in weighing injustice vs. perceived justice. Furthermore, strict principle and belief against the existence of punishment, pain, blame, shame, and so on. The relational healing system should not be a "council of aldermen". It should be like Rabbis, monastic monks, Vedic Brahmins, and extremely idealistic empaths. A person can't technically be their own relational healer if a relational healing system exists that defines itself so.

What happens when an ordinary person, who is not formally a relational healer, needs relational healing, and believes the relational healing system is wrong (e.g. someone with extreme empathy who also has extreme social anxiety)? They too are "healing shamans" and if that individual really is "ordinary" — that is, common, or from impoverished means — or is in a position of no power — should be naturally given exceptional respect by relational healers.

Pretty much, "whoever's unhappy, for whatever reason, is right, until we're all happy and legitimately." By legitimately, in case that's pork barrel, I mean "genuinely". But another interpretation is "not just expressly". That, is an interesting consideration since many people think they're content when they're not. I don't think it's a relational healer's job to intervene in those circumstances, because a relational healer is a mediator, not an individual therapist/doctor. For that, I think the current existing psychotherapy and medical institutions need to be reformed to prioritize things like championing economic justice and basic necessities for health and wellbeing not afforded by many people without great stress, despite their contentment. To elaborate, I mean medical institutions should acknowledge their responsibility as medical institutions in securing for their patients economic and psychological justice more than pharmaceutical treatment. The use of botanicals still needs extraordinary study and a different philosophy than what medical institutions and their current doctors can legitamately provide.

An example study for relational healing is to have interested freshmen within a university year agree to participate and see how it affects satisfaction, mental health outcomes, and what they think of the different trialed methods, with PhD psychology students and supervisors in charge of designing the test program methods for their respective cohorts, ideally hundreds of people grouped by reported or predicted social circle. 

In order to avoid the spiritual root of this becoming clinical, the work must be done in tandem with the philosophy and, for example, Rabbinic, department.

In order to avoid imposter-syndrome complexes, those PhD students and supervisors have to satisfy the religious disciplines proposed by the spiritual teachers working in collaboration with them, that those relational healers and teachers may adapt over time as per the need of the relational healing, such as, if a student has expended enormous (that is, exceptional) amount of effort and time towards extremely ascetic disciplines and ultimately found their healing to work better without some or all of them, across variations of exercise and context.

In the ideal, relational workers should be religious workers — though not bound to any one religion — who operate across the Earth, like the ancient wandering Brahmins of India, but healing the relationally-rooted complexes that are most fundamental to humanity's sicknesses, both mental and physiological.

The goal of relational healers is collective world peace, between every individual. Even when everybody except just one is content. Utopia. And not in a dystopian sense. In an enlightened Garden-of-Eden sense.

The brain that unites all of us would like its individual neurons to play nice.
