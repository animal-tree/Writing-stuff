I wrote this entirely with a stream of consciousness language model and don't identify with any of the words:

Some points of fact just to keep some consistency:

- I do like Buffy

How I would write the end of Buffy, the show whose 6th season was one of its best, and 7th declined spontaneously upon criticism from studio execs at the new broadcasting station and declining/stagnating ratings.

When Buffy died in the 5th season and resurrected again at the hands of her friends, she drifted ever closer to Spike, who she hated but who helped her in season 5 massively, to save the world and Dawn, her sister. Now Buffy is back, out her grave, and expressing, subtly and then much less subtly, that she'd rather be in it. Death, as she reveals in the musical episode "Once More With feeling" was /heeaven/. Being back alive hurt and the only person who understood it was Spike. Spike loved Buffy and he was there for her, unconditionally. He proved to her again and again, and finally, at the end of season 6, he did the unprecedented: he cured his own vampirism. This has never happened. Not even with Angel. Angel, Buffy's first lover, the "vampire with a soul" who she killed when he lost it again. ("Then he had his own spinoff, which was pretty, pretty good", Angel and for some reason Larry David add. Okay fuck off). But angel had his soul restored by a gypsy.

Spike, as a vampire, undid his vampirism, by choice of conscious will, even without one.

Spike was a love-despairing poet, whose unrequited love in his origin days was a tragedy. He loved and fancied and it was characterized as comedic. Just the longing of a nerd with no woman-skills. Angel could say that, effectively.

But Spike was extremely poetic, so much so that he fell in love with the vampire, Drusilla, who "mothered" him. And then stayed together. And it was creepy. But Drusilla was there for him, in love. She requited his love in full, and together they were vampires. And they were evil, the whole group, including Angel.

Something in Spike's heart — and notice this is ever-more becoming a story about Spike, not by my intent — pulled through to choose love, love for Buffy, over his physical actual nature as a vampire. And it took seasons. 5 seasons, not one episode. The show dragged it out for 5 seasons, not knowing where it was going, letting it play out as a stream of consciousness in the narrative's own direction, choosing the qualia that best signified the meaning of what was happening. And the writers knew it. And the show got dark.

Helmed by Marti Noxon, Spike tried to rape Buffy. Before that, he schemed to kill all of her friends and families, and almost did many times. Both of those things are bad.

"The show delved into areas of conversation that no one in TV history ever had, and it proved something. Spike became /everyone's/ favorite character. Raise your hand if you don't like Spike. 

No one can..." - this part was pork-belly'ed by someone.

But he fought for his goodness, and we watched his change and sincerity through 6 years, including, surprisingly, in the seventh season, where that story happened to be the only one still remaining "active" — alive — heart pumping.

How Buffy Should Have Proceeded After Season 6

It's a story that I can only write in my head, but it's a beautiful story that tells the depth of everything that happened between Giles and Buffy, Willow and Xander, Willow and Buffy, and mostly that (I feel like Andrew just wrote that). But it wouldn't have been PG, in any way. Giles resented Buffy and himself. Willow just summoned all the forces of evil and darkness within her. Xander was heartbroken by Anya, in some weird paradoxical way. Anya. Almost forgot. Xander and Anya had something. Season 7 just killed her off?

Anyway, it'd be a pretty bad show if all of those threads, developing from season 1, were forgotten, in place of narratively contrived memories that re-neg most of what has been subtextually established — well.

I think storytellers are "mini Gods". That we parallel processes of God's own logics. That, story is a higher-order logic not known yet , intellectually/academically, by man.
