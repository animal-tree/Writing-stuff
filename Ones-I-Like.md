### Telepathy (Archetypal Madness)

I am Chenliang, Sam's advisor. He writes this with telepathic interference from Josh, Sam's friend. Together, and this is Sam speaking, we shall derive the universe. Not derivatively of course. That would require ample physical sciences background. But sufficiently well-reasonedly, with made-up words here and there. Let's begin with a less exhausting setup. "I observe." It is true, therefore it is. At any rate, fading into sleep-deprivative exhaustion as I may be, I am reluctant to say this won't work. Largely because of the intensive time and money — "minimum wage" Josh chimes in — investment that has gone into this project. Well, so be it. The whole of the universe, in one shebang. It starts with time. But time exists as a physical construct not a mathematically deduced one. So let us find an incredibly stupid place to hide it. In equivalence.

Alright. Given $A = B$, we know $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow A$. We don't know *when* $A \rightarrow B$. Is it in $1$ deductive step $A \rightarrow_1 B$? Is it in $n$ deductive steps $A \rightarrow_n B$. From this, we get a cheap hacky way to derive something out of literally nothing.

Let us start with nothing $\emptyset$.

Don't regard it as the empty set. Don't regard it at all.

$\emptyset_0 = \emptyset_1 = \cdots$

are all nothing, with just subscripts added.

There we now have causality, constrained only to a cyclical loop between every nothing and every other nothing. e.g.

$\emptyset_0 \rightarrow \emptyset_1 \rightarrow \cdots$

$\emptyset_0 \leftarrow \emptyset_1 \leftarrow \cdots$

These nodes can connect in any number of ways and create a multi-branched graph. The ambiguities are not necessary. Let us define one such branch/construct that we can say is "Turing equivalent" and be done with it.

Cosmogenesis:

A "grammar" — or word (if we want to make Biblical allusions/puns) — that is Turing equivalent, from nothing.

Go:

How about a tape of $\emptyset_{0,i}$ and $\emptyset_{1,i}$ (zeros and ones, or yins and yangs if you want), where $i$ lets us hackily denote the position on the tape, with implications from each non-sensical bit at deductive step $n$ to each non-sensical bit at deductive step $n + 1$.

The "halt" can be cosmo-genocide, which we are not interested in solving. $\square$

### Elaboration

Okay, we've gotten a construct for time and an unhalting Turing machine that presumably eventually (or somehow) cycles back to its origin starting state. We got this from hacking the definition of equivalence. We will take a step back now and derive it a little more formally. It is stupid, but perhaps there's nothing stopping us from doing this re-defining and obtaining a deductive logic from which cosmogenesis could theoretically make sense, noting: the Big Bang Theory is not a cosmogenesis theory and chronicles the early moments and evolution of the observable beginning of the universe. An un-mythological cosmogenesis theory has, perhaps, yet to be proposed in the scope of deduction. Myths, such as my favorite being Tolkien's cosmogenesis allegory (yes it is an allegory) of the universe arising from a musical theme, do exist and perhaps have extreme truth to them, all.

**Definition 1.** $($ Axiom  $A ) =_1 (\exists A)$.

**Definition 2.** $($ Definition $A =_1 B) =_1 (\exists (A =_1 B))$. 

**Definition 3.** $($ Equivalence $A = B) =_1 (A \rightarrow_n B, B \rightarrow_m A, n, m \in \mathbb{N})$, where $n, m$ are deductive steps, meaning $n, m$ statements must be deduced between $A$ and $B$ and $B$ and $A$ respectively. $A =_1 B$ substitutes the traditional equality operator:

Traditional equivalence $(A =_1 B) =_1 (A \rightarrow_1 B, B \rightarrow_1 A)$.

For example, $(A \rightarrow_2 C) =_1 (A \rightarrow_1 B \rightarrow_1 C)$ for some mandatory intermediary $B$.

**Definition 4.** $($ Implication $A \rightarrow_1 B) =_1 (\exists A \rightarrow_1 \exists B)$.

**Definition 5.** $($ Deduction/proof $A \rightarrow B) =_1 (A \rightarrow_n B) =_1 (\exists A \rightarrow_n \exists B)$.

---

$A$ and $B$ are anything defined... 

Traditional equivalence is fully generalized to by this more-general definition of equivalence, meaning any previous use of equivalence may, to the best of our ability to tell, be substituted with this new one.

Likewise, any implication $A \rightarrow B$ can be substituted with $A \rightarrow_n B$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ w.l.o.g..

Later (on the next episode of Doctor Who, seeing as we just literally hacked time): 

**Definition 3 (Modified).** $0 \leq \mathbf{P}(A \rightarrow_n B) \leq 1$  can be non-deterministic.

### What is Consciousness?

Consciousness is collisions.

Consciousness is collisions in matter — elementary particles, atoms, boats, whatever you want to envision colliding. Each "bump" creates a "feeling" in space. 

Therefore as you read this, your computer — perhaps where you're reading it — is "feeling" the *whirring* of electrons. It's — probably — nothing like human consciousness, and in its current form never will be.

That's not to say it can't be. The open/close logic gates of a computer do parallel the biological activate-and-spike neuron. ("activate" is borrowing jargon from "AI").

However, its composition of silicon and physical metals is *not* the same combo of bumps and giggles that your brain goes through, not the same hormonal explosions, or spinal zaps, or neurotransmitter ooglidoos.

Consciousness is collisions in everything. You are conscious because somehow those collisions "entangle". They do so locally, at least at the hierarchical level of it that we can be sure of — ourselves. That local entanglement in the fabric of physics and spacetime, is you. Its rich complexities are what define you. Its what distinguishes you from the algorithm that runs in whirring electrons of your computer's transisters and microchips.

There are many more questions to ask, not just the ones hinted at (collective consciousness? intelligence in the fabric of spacetime?)

For example, less interesting but to stay on theme (consciousness as a physical feeling in everything), what does your computer feel as its algorithmic binary zips and zaps of electrons change through its web of metallic logic gates? Most likely, nothing the rest of the universe doesn't sort of feel. It's not human(-like) consciousness.

But, at some grander level, maybe it is?

Neither is your arm or leg.

Consciousness is composed of many parts. It's not one single body, yet it is. Your brain is a parthenon of Gods, a whole myth of memories and relationships and archetypes, and they singularize, much like your arm or leg, but they're not you.

To what being might we be thumbs on some ungodly control stick?

And, with neuromorphic computers, can we one day approach synthesizing human-like consciousness? Answer: we're not close. But we might be able to grow it in a lab. but we might want to double-think that.

The little gadget monster of this GitHub account's profile picture, was in fact — backstory — *grown* in a lab. This myth now exists as representation, but besides the stirring bumps and gigglies of your brain, no, that representation, drawn in precise detail on my profile, is not human-like conscious.

Here's a thought experiment.

What if you drew in a flipbook every precise detail of a human-brain. A *biig* flipbook. Paper and regular pen. Then you flipped its pages. From time $t$ to time $t + n$. Would that hand-drawing on paper be conscious? Could you, produce human-consciousness by drawing on a paper with pen?

By my interpretation, that flipbook would be as conscious as a flipbook with pen ink on it, not as a human.

### Why Consciousness is Probably Matter

Why Consciousness is probably matter

Representation is absurd. We could make a flipbook human-like-conscious with pen ink.

Matter and representation is hard to define, but neurons across humans have different encoding representations and embedding semantics that aren’t shared in a unified language of “these neural patterns are strictly necessary for consciousness.” Therefore the matter is what’s held constant, not the representations. Brains also come in different shapes and sizes.

Lastly, the question is what level of matter. Is all matter somewhat conscious? How does it entangle into human-like consciousness? Chemists and physcists have no experimental evidence of a “consciousness” source or pinpointed emergence. The idea of consciousness as like fire, emerging upon just the right combustion of elements is intuitive, but would require new insights in chemistry and physics. The simplest answer, without contradicting or adding to any known laws of physics is that consciousness is an innate property of the matter that already exists. Somehow it entangles into richer, more complex forms like human-consciousness. Perhaps literally through a process of quantum entanglement between the locally isolated combustions, reactions, and voltage-mediated collisions of our brains.

### Fire

The idea of saying everything is one is counterintuitive to most people.

It’s like saying “fire is water.”

Therefore, below we will more or less prove that fire is water. Fire, actually, is water.

For fun. Let’s begin.

Fire is a result of compounds breaking in such a way that their fragments bond with oxygen in the air and their rupture releases a hailstorm of electrons, sharp as knives, triggering a chain reaction of more such compounds breaking up.

Those compounds are called hydrocarbons, in the case of, for example, wood. Wood is hydrocarbons. Hydrogen and carbon. Paired together in holy divorcable matrimony.

Now when you rub them together hard and long enough with enough friction, you can rupture those bonds! After all, they’re held together quite precariously by gravity and electromagnetism and all that. Squeeze ‘em hard enough and they’ll more-or-less split.

So you rub two sticks together, say, using the bow-drill method (for fire making), and you rupture those hydrocarbons into hydrogens and carbons. Now the hydrogen will bond with the oxygen (if you’re lucky), that is, in the air, and the carbon will bond with the oxygen (if you’re unlucky), and this all-around combo-reconfiguration-of-bonding<sup>TM</sup> tends to leave excess electrons that shoot off like knives into your eyes — and also potentially into other atoms and hydrocarbons. So now that emission is what you see. It’s a spark!

If enough hydrocarbons are hanging around, say you put the ember in some tinder, now those little hailstorms will trigger a chain reaction. Like knives, they’ll cut through the other hydrocarbons present, creating instability — and more shooting electrons. 

Meanwhile, those broken off hydrogens bonded to oxygen — you know what they are? Water! Water vapor technically. Steam, if you like, with its composition of oxygen and hydrogen amidst a hailstorm of electrons. That “electricy water” is fire. 

Now the carbons on the other hand can also bond with oxygen. And that creates CO2. Meanwhile, some non-combustible elements in the mix (since non-charcoal wood for example is composed combustibly of more than just hydrocarbons) create ash and, its rising form, lifted by those rising gasses and water, smoke. 

(But does that mean fire is also CO2? Depending on the composition, maybe, [though not necessarily](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-burn-something-without-producing-CO2) and [varies](https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-if-steam-contains-water-what-does-smoke-from-fire-contain-172505))

“Electriquey steam with some residue” — FIRE — in 5 words.

So fire is water? Yes, electricy water. It is possible. It’s water with some electrons flying out creating a photoelectric rainbow of red and blue and yellow in your survival-expert-tool-wielding human eyes.

That’s fire !

That swarm of electrons keeps the reaction going. It's why it feels hot and why the hydrogens and oxygens are energized to bond in the first place, where for example ordinary atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen might not, or for that matter water. Water at room temperature is pretty good at shutting those electrons down. So is CO2 for that matter. 

---

But if the fire is hot enough, as in magnesium fires, then you need something really dry, that isn't water or CO2, like copper, to separate the reactants from the oxygen frenzying it. In that case, water can actually fuel it. Though in fires like that, water doesn't come into the picture and we're just dealing with magnesium and all the pollution needed to get it burning to such a hot degree. Unless, for example, that temperature were reached by the energy of the sun, whose hydrogens "fuse" into helium, or by the rupture of the atom e.g. uranium or plutonium as in the controlled atomic bomb power of nuclear fission, combined sometimes with fusion as in the hydrogen bomb, or man-induced fusion: via the use of deuterium ("heavy water"). That is, water with one extra neutron, whose, and I say this with caution, knife-cut can act a bit like an electron in causing some disarray, if misused — that, a far deviation from the innocent days of nature.[^1]

Unlike fission, fusion, and unrenewable energy sources, "fire" in the primitive sense of our ancestor-paleolithic days in nature, is, vaporized regular H20, with no-neutrons, water (enchanted) by the power of electrons. With residue and sustainable levels of CO2 that the trees can breathe.

That is the Null Hypothesis by which I define words. [There was a time by the way when "blue" didn't exist](https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2021/02/09/the-curious-case-of-the-missing-color-blue/#:~:text=It%20turns%20out%20the%20color,see”%20blue%20until%20modern%20times!).
