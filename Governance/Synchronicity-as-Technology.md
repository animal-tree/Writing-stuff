Like every technology, synchronicity can be manipulated. Taken to governmental levels as a science, power structures absolutely can conspire to create false synchronicities to control populations under the premise of “God”. However, that’s somewhat contradictory because, God would not allow it to get to such a level irreversibly, would he? Or such a level, where people are still controllable by those mechanisms, of conscious recognition of coincidence?  Usually, God leaves it to the unconscious. But sometimes he acts, as I’ve found, and perhaps far more often than is realized. Bernie’s bird, and the “Shadow” corp, and the timing of Trump and Covid and Super Tuesday, I think, were synchronicities not deliberated/pre-meditated by any conscious human collective or organization to be synchronicities, but also I don’t think they were coincidence, nor just causally connected by a third “traditionally causal” factor as known by the modern laws of physics.
