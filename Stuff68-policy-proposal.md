# An antidote to shamanism/communism

Shamanism is the practice of ritualistic healing between humans that emphasises the psychic, spiritual, relational, and sometimes botanical dimensions of human health. It is a sick and vile practice because it assumes that humans haven’t mastered the human organism through pharmacology and surgery, the modern variants that rule as the medical *axis mundi*, world-center. The argument I am making is facetious and this work is meant as an incisive critique of one of these two and I’ll let you guess which one. However, for tolerance purposes, I will claim hereforth that the problem I am addressing hereforth-hereforth is the former — shamanism — and not the latter — modern medical practice — since that is a much easier strawman for me.

One problem of shamanism and not the modern medical system is the lack of focus on interpersonal relationships.

Another problem of shamanism and not the modern medical system is what I call “the paradigm of judgementalism.”

Yet another is the powerlessness of the individual psyche to atone with the core root fires and destructions of their disease.

Meanwhile, while the modern medical system recognizes the essentialness of touch and eye contact, between compatible and well-bonded humans, shamanism struggles in catching up to this wisdom, being that it’s so outdated and antiquated, and prejudiced against interpersonal love.

Also, the modern medical system is reliable at addressing the economic underpinnings of disease, with its perfect and magical elixirs of Big-Pharma-candy, while shamanism has never to my knowledge proposed a solution to wealth inequality.

Obviously the modern medical system has mastered all of these shortcomings of shamanism and needs no further interrogation. However, due to the threat of woke hippies reviving shamanic philosophy, it is of utmost importance that these shortcomings be investigated further in this work, with no offense meant to the perfect and inscrutable modern medical system, who I love. Praise be.

As a side note, why do I get the sense that the linguistic forces that help me write these ideas are biased against their expression? Because the memories on which these ideas are emotionally rooted involve people whose judgements actively de-mobilize the rest of my brain from expressing them. As is the inexpressible truth of inner dimensions: they parallel relational outer ones, whether we realize it psychotherapeutically or not. This is something that the modern medical system both understands and addresses with actualized policy, whereas shamanism pretends that those spirits are just disorders.

It is precisely because of these intervening spirits — “spectres of judgement” — that I am less motivated to record my concrete policy proposals than I am to write this vague exposition. Then again, if those spectres of judgement didn’t exist, there’d be no need for the concrete policy proposals to address the causal and symptomatic factors of their existence.

Now, the spectre of communism that Marx talked about is certainly much worse than this spectre of judgementalism. After all, communism is about people having more power over others, ruling them with unjust judgements based on unjust metrics such as capital or possession of resources. While judgementalism is relatively harmless.

Again, I’m being facetious. Judgementalism is about how our culture teaches us to judge one another, and our individual roles in judging. While Marxism has never really happened, owing to the fervency or resurgence of capital and power structures, judgements happen everyday and hence that spectre is somewhat more real. But, for facetiousness sake, let’s say, “Judgement has never hurt anybody. Sticks and stones. Marx wanted Gulags.”

Judgement, however, is so pervasive in our culture that every individual, no matter how woke or “red pill’d”, lives on one side of that philosophical coin as the other, the coin of judgement: the condemnation of the socially wealthy of the socially less-wealthy: A.K.A. high school popularity contests, drama, and coping mechanisms, but exaggerated to adult issues. 

I don’t have the will to keep writing this. Concrete policy proposals are the only way to convey this message without the biases of my own language and mental limits interfering.

Elaboration follows below.

1. Radical right to die - legalized physician-assisted euthanasia, provided only a 1-year wait period and a minimum age of 25.
2. Relational healers - social workers for the relational therapy between individuals in the general populace not necessarily married or related, with systems in place for remedying and mediating trauma separations, rejections, perceived-unjust judgements, and gulfs.  
3. Intimacy-conscious society and workers - medical and social essentialness of touch and eye contact, between compatible and well-bonded humans, including sex. Adjunct to that, but distinct, is legalized sex work not meant for healing (nor medical nor sacredness nor learning nor communal purposes). Furthermore, legalized nudity areas and even public areas where sex is permitted.
4. Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolution -  [see my humanitarian acts of faith plan](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff58-Israel-Palestine.md).
5. Ending world hunger and ending healthy-food shortages - autonomous fishing drones with line, hook, and lure, powered by self-sustaining solar technologies thanks to abundance of sunlight and independence from weather conditions of high-altitude, and helium airships with tanks inside to store the fish and deliver back yields of healthy, wild-caught fish. Sustainabilty practices still apply. A limit can also be put on how many generations these wild-caught fish can be farmed as well after being caught, so as to balance abundance with permaculture. Can be accomplished through simple neural network behavior cloning / imitation learning / demonstration learning with a fleet of many fisherman drones in parallel to initially collect data. Training only has to happen once and then wild-caught, fresh fish becomes free and abundantly available (assuming sustainability practices) for our generation and all future generations for the rest of time. Doable in less than a year with today's technology pretty easily.
6. 6-hour work week (or more *if you want*). The infrastructure for most essentials is already built and can be automated with self-sustaining technologies. But first we have to redefine a little more carefully what actually is “essential” to human wellbeing, happiness, quality of life, and satisfaction. That definition in my opinion is primarily relationships and food, but also housing, education, and healthcare. Most of this as it's done today can be done as well or better by machines, though that’s not to say how education and healthcare are done today is good. 
7. Nationalize internet and net neutrality, since the infrastructure is already built and the cable companies are pretty much just stealing from consumers in exchange for no real labor or work on the provider’s part. Verizon Visible and Mint Mobile prove how much more can be done for less, and arguably their infrastructure is even more difficult to maintain.
8. Nature camping areas that are free to camp in year-round in every municipality. These are already available, but why not expand it together with the national parks budget?
9. Independent/de-centralized power and transition to solar (which actually is more than sufficient for every non-industrial need), including powering your home’s electricity and heat and recharging an electric car, from communal batteries as well as nationalized solar shingles, with drones that can receive and carry charge above and across weather conditions back to communal batteries. Most energy consumption is industrial, not domestic. Solar energy is plentiful and sufficient for domestic energy demand. Atoms don’t need to be split and fused to power your electricity and heat consumption. Solar is free.
10. AutoInsurance4All, or don’t mandate it. It’s illegal to own a car in America: you legally are required to pay a “subscription” fee, even if you’re unemployed (auto insurance is mandatory by law). There are no existing government welfare programs (including state) to help poor people pay for auto insurance. Meanwhile, a person can get fined and imprisoned if they drive a car without it. Auto insurance can cost several thousand dollars per year, almost as much as the health insurance that some employers cover. In the vast majority of American cities and towns, a car is necessary for normal daily living, and, to reiterate, requires a subscription.
11. Physics re-interpretations and revolutions that revitalize our understanding of what is possible in the world, and remind us of what is beautiful, and bring us back to symbiotic harmony in our cognitive minds (and spirits) with nature and our own hearts.
12. Radical right to live.

The constancy of light *in vacuo* across reference frames taught us the tolerance of the weird and bizarre. The principle of relativity taught us the essentialness of equality: my physics are your physics; your physics are my physics.

Just as the neoconservative-neoliberalism of the 2000s gave way to the woke-movement of the mid-2010s, the arc of time continues to bend in a direction of more justice, as Martin Luther King Jr. observed it always would. The nuance of the mid-2020s into the 2030s will be postulated by humbling awakenings to our misunderstandings throughout even the recent past, from the last century of physics to the modern decades of progress.

While our woke renaissance/enlightenment is a leap forward, it is still entrenched in what I call “the paradigm of judgementalism” that predated it and survives, perhaps worse than its condition just a decade or two ago.

We are neurons in a neural network that is hemorrhaged, sick with tumor, and demented. 

But, all that being said, at least we’re not shamans or communists. 

# Right to die

*[Trigger warnings: suicide, rape.]*

It’s such a rare view that I have a hard time expressing to people, but it’s politically and philosophically valid. Right To Die is a human right. I’d support a wait period, of maybe a year or so, and age restrictions, but to make people who are suffering have to resort to undignified deaths is abominable. They deserve better. And as I told my therapist trying to convince him of this view (from a political perspective), it’s not about helping people to die; it’s about giving them the peace of mind, courage, and serenity to live in the face of unbearable suffering. I know the option of suicide consoles me a lot, but the way it is, it’s still a lonely, scary, isolated, and undignified process. 

The impossibility of talking about suicide ideation in our society without the threat of being hospitalized and coercively drugged increases the likelihood of suicide for people. They can’t turn to clinicians without the threat of an asylum and chemicals. And the right-to-die gives people peace of mind, enough to relax and feel safe in times of extreme suffering and misery. Without it, there’s “no exit.” As Sartre described, “hell is other people” and from that Hell, there is “No Exit.” Without right-to-die, suicide victims die undignified deaths. With right-to-die, innocent people don’t have to witness bodies splattering from buildings or in front of locomotives, or walls draped with blood from a gun, and the suicide victim doesn’t have to resort to gruesome and solitary methods like that lacking the resources and knowledge/research ability for safer ones. And most of all, I think it’s actually healing to have that option. I guess more points to add are the usual ones about vegetative states or near-terminal misery, e.g., as the author of the Discworld series and one of my favorite writers Terry Pratchett advocated. 

The option to die is more agony-relieving than anything else, and trying to take it away contributes to suicide ideation and the resorting of the victim to methods that do not give their final days dignity. 

It is a society’s responsibility to negotiate for the lives of its individuals, not the individuals’ to give their lives to serving an unjust society.

# Hypothetical infringement and dialogue 

I can imagine a dialogue like this. A relational healer tells Jane, “Sam is really depressed and needs a reply from you.” She doesn’t reply, or rather, tells the relational healer that she chooses not to reply, and the relational healer relays as much to me. Note: communication with the relational healer is necessary by non-punitive but explicit law. However, the relational healer has learned how to communicate between individuals. Their job is to turn hate into love, resolve conflict, and foster peace between any two individuals on Earth. I relay to the relational healer that I am still depressed. The relational healer believes me and relays as much to Jane. These communications happen in person. Again, Jane rejects the request to reply and the relational healer again communicates that me. I communicate that the depression this causes me has made me decide to take the right to die option. Now, in this case, the relational healer, from a shamanic non-bureaucratic perspective, can see that I’m sincere and that I both mean to go through with that and I mean no harm nor infringement to Jane, and the relational healer communicates this to Jane, stressing that I have decided on this right to die path because of the situation. Normally, these circumstances aren’t observed in their literal reality or communicated, but due to the legalization of right to die, the expectation of this outcome is anticipated well in advance. Now Jane might say, “I’ll take that risk.” And that is her right, and the relational healer may attempt everything in their shamanic power, knowledge, and understanding to fight for the healing of the situation in what ways are possible, acting relationally, respecting my right to die and Jane’s right to ignore. 

*[This paragraph was "pork barelled". See last section]*</br>
Now, someone else might abuse this privilege. My dad for example might threaten — distinct from the previous sincerity — to “take the right to die option” if my mom were not to reply to him. In this case, the relational healer might communicate as much: he says he’ll do it but I am not sure he means it sincerely nor that this is 100% about you personally. It might be manipulative and the relational healer has the knowledge, understanding, and wisdom to uniquely mediate these conversations as suited to the relational illness at the axis of each unique divide. The work of this healer is to create love and world peace, and the dawn of an actualized utopia. They are shamans systematized. Common people and common relationships are where all war and struggle, and even quite often physical disease, begin. Note: I don't know my dad, I don't remember him, and this is purely hypothetical. My mom actually suggested I don't include this paragraph, but it illustrates an "opposing view", specifically, that someone might hypothetically try to use Right To Die insincerely/abusively. I don't think this is a good characterization of human nature and shamanic healers should understand that. My mom is not aware that I am suicidal and I have only relayed her over a long period of time the general policies that I think should be implemented, just as I did my professional therapist, who I can no longer see due to the large bill he sent me and the lack of health insurance by the way due to being terminated. My mom saw a much shorter, earlier draft of this that was not meant as a suicide note, and didn't include an elaboration section of Right To Die (those are actually old paragraphs that I retrieved from text conversations with people, including that I made in a public Discord, because they summarized my view well), only the list of policies in the "Antidote to shamanism/communism" context, and a rougher version of this section and the next two. From what I understand, my dad is actually smart and hard working, was a good father to my sister and me, and my mom and him have had text conversations even recently, so I believe things are amicable but that my mom has personal reasons to not like him and that this paragraph isn't exacty the kind of "bad" that she sees him as. Illustrates a hypothetical opposing view though. I never knew him.

In contrast to shamanic methods, a psychiatrist might coerce a patient into a prescription of a certain set of chemicals and act exclusively but ineffectively on that one individual and not the social condition. This action repeatedly damaged me neurologically, physiologically, and made my life worse in every measurable and unmeasurable way. Therapists are also limited in social regards/capacities, which are the most important to society's mental health. Either way, I earned less than minimum wage and had health insurance, and was still billed some amount before the termination, and am now further in [debt](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/indebted.md). 

Existing medical practitioners often cite “helping people” as their motivation for seeking the job. However, while nurses and doctors can help in compliance with hospital rules, obediences, and practices, it is observably true that oftentimes this does not translate into actual help. The only way to help people directly in contemporary society is to be there for your friends: to help them move, to support them after breakups, to be caring and helpful directly to the people in your life and in your social circumstances. It is the microcosmic shamanic role. But no such role exists at systematized levels, and the obligatory or obedience-based nature of existing “help” professions undermines the truthfulness of their help on the social condition. Furthermore, the existing metrics of help are, for example, “how many patients you transferred rooms”, “how many patients you injected”, “how many prescriptions did you make sure were consumed”, and not “how much love did I create.” Seeing the creation of love is and should be the metric for evaluating a professional’s help to other people.

Relational healing can do that. Individual-centric therapy barely can sometimes maybe, but really can't. It's not infringement. And not exactly clinical. Relational healing is spiritual healing. Relational healing, facilitated by those rare-ish empaths who understand the principles of shamanism and the psychic dimensions between people, is the systematizing of the highest wisdom in the human tribe: the shaman. Relationship processes are spiritual processes. Every myth, story, and spiritual journey has consciously or not been a relational journey. The human psyche is composed of relationship memory. When Jane blocked me, I consolidated my suicide plan. This was before losing my therapist. This was before losing my job. Those things combined with the medical [malpractice](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff65-opposing-views.md)[^1] damages compounded. And I hate this suicide note. Thankfully I have a thousand more that I've written in my notes and journals and I leave my laptop password and those journals with my mom to do what she decides with.

# Importance to trans people and women

One more thing: as Bernie Sanders talks about economic injustice more sincerely than any other politician, and issues such as ending corruption in our elections, he is — explicitly or not — fighting for black rights to a larger extent than any other politician who contends against him in an election, even those who preach explicitly about the specific demographics whose interests they claim they will defend. Biden’s policy does not help black people as much as Bernie’s. But the message of that advocacy is more explicitly highlighted. Biden for example might stress an entire speech about his relationship with Obama and hand-wavy details about their support of black rights. Bernie’s expression of that might be more succinct and rooted in the concrete wealth redistribution and taxations on the rich that he explicitly plans, which would as he might point out, help black people more than white people.

The two policies I want to highlight for this reason now are (policy #2) relational healing and (policy #3) intimacy-conscious society via medical touch and eye contact between compatible and well-bonded individuals and legalized sex work and nudity.

While many of these policies might help with the loneliness and alienation epidemic expressed recently by men — via concrete policy — they more generally address the loneliness and alienation experience that every group suffers: men, women, and trans people. Trans people and men are the most likely demographics to commit suicide, more so than women, so perhaps these policies would disproportionately help trans people and men.

However, multiple of these policies address the root causes that lead modern people to commit terrible acts such as rape. There are existing movements that have addressed the issue of sexual assault via the call to awareness of its ubiquitousness, as expressed by the “me too” memetic. But these movements have not proposed many actionable policies that can become universal law. For example, it’s impossible to systematize a law prohibiting employers from dating employees. That would be an infringement on rights, but it is now made “custom” and “social knowledge”, or a kind of manners, to frown upon and shun such relationships, with HR resources that women can turn to and a general etiquette that more people sense they should obey, though of course such an etiquette might reach the consciousness quite confusingly to, for example, someone on the autism spectrum. But while that is a mostly-good social custom, what I am proposing is a systemic policy. No legal, systemic policy was proposed on these issues before (to my knowledge), and that cannot be overstressed. 

These violences stem from social rejection in my opinion, a view agreed upon by psychotherapy studies and experts, and emphatically in my opinion: not from human nature. They are as natural to humans as murder of other humans in my opinion, and not the nature that is inherent to humankind. Policy #2 addresses social rejection, and is non-negligible in treating that dysfunction that leads to violence and rape, more so even than policy #3 which addresses the issue seriously and importantly but more superficially, as it does not heal the existing scars and divides that fuel those madnesses.

The policies being proposed now are actually less controversial than, for example, universally prohibiting workplace relationships, in my opinion, and less austere and oppressive on the social spheres innate and primal to human spirit and freedom. The shaman is an archetypal role in the human tribe, whose wisdom has not been integrated by human society and our sick systems.

# Implementation

The field of psychotherapy is only a century old. The proposed field extends psychotherapy to the relational context such that a new kind of medical practitioner and philosophy can be investigated, majored in, and practiced.

This is more literal and specific than many people are comfortable articulating and discussing, but nothing about it is terribly radical. The vague resolutions that exist now of the progressive movement are principled on the same tenets, such as sex-positivity and non-prejudiced (non-judgmental) compassion and tolerance for others, as well as communication. If you have a concrete idea, then share it, but otherwise herein is the only one proposed in the world to my knowledge that includes literal systemic policy. Many of us like shamanism vaguely, but the literalism of this frightens people. Somehow psychiatrists and therapists are accepted, but a new field around relational healing literalized is too real perhaps for comfortable consumption unless it’s actualized, and then becomes obvious as the evolution necessity of human wisdom.

# Big Disclaimer

I didn’t mean for the first part to be sarcastic. My language centers [forgotten]. [forgotten] their porkbarrel to convey what I wanted to. 

---

This linguistic forgetting is part of why I’m going to kill myself. The above would’ve sounded good if not for those language centers that regulate my memory and expression. 1-2 sentences were omitted that were needed to the literal meaning of what I was saying, out of a total of 4. 

This was necessary context to a suicide note (though originally, an essay) that I wrote. 

---

Here is my attempt to recreate, though I wasn’t able to do so quite as eloquently and succinctly:

I didn’t mean for the first part to be sarcastic. My language centers take on a life of their own somehow and spin my writing against my will. The part of me that I consciously control, the observer behind which memories and word associations are permitted me by my brain, was consistent in turning those variations of style and strangely/suspiciously agenda into my consistent worldview. In order to do that, I had to make the first part sarcastic. The sarcasm appeared in spite of their porkbarrel as I navigated their controls to still convey what I meant to, not by my choice if you can believe me as I write now through those very language centers. I think the split between my spirit (me) and cognitive processes (language centers) is due to social relational functions in the brain resultant from extreme social ostracization. This (first part of above essay) doesn’t start out reading sincere but through specificity I was able to convey the meaning of what I wanted to though not in the way I would’ve wanted to, and I leave it to the judgement of the reader to understand the complicated asymmetry between language and intent. The policies described would have prevented my death and none of this is or ever was meant to sound insincere. There are parts of my brain I can only guide, but can’t control. If the “Word” is a metaphor for the universe, then it is like the laws of physics that somehow grammatically obstruct me even as my spirit fights through. I did with my writing what I could to turn its inexplicable slants into my meanings, including, in the first portion, overtly emphasizing unambiguously that those words through which I was able to write were saying the opposite of what they meant. But it is through that writing only that I was able to write this controversial and complicated essay in the first place, while actively keeping it in line with my own spirit and the beliefs that I as the inner observer hold transcendent to the words that my brain functions give me. I recognize that none of that is observable from outside if you just start reading this without that overwhelming amount of context, and that the judgements you’d make would forget all of what I just said. The short summary is: it is like a legislative bill penned by someone who genuinely cares but its phrasing and style of expression are diluted by the [“porkbarrel”](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=pork+barrel&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) legislation of my language centers, whose functions I think are grammatically regulated in unconscious ways by existing relational emulations of collective social dynamics and personal ones in my life, and I think all of us suffer the same linguistic “Word” laws that oppress our own spirits, usually without our “knowledge.” In other words, I tried to make it relatable and good and consistent with my beliefs and views while the oppressions and openings given by those word regulators twisted and obstructed every phrase. I hope that makes sense. I hope you can understand that scientifically, as a symbiotic function of all of our brains, and not as insanity. Well, meant for symbiosis but most likely promoting the opposite, like a tower of babble (babble, as in, bla bla bla), and, yes, allegory to Tower of Babel.

My linguistic meaning shouldn't depend on this much specificity though. The original 3-4 sentences conveyed all of this succinctly but more accessibly. Ideally, if specificity were the point, I would have both written the short version un-obstructed and the long version detailed now. Thanks to some memory and effort, I was able to sort of do both, but that is hugely frustrating, and the struggle ongoing.

To reiterate reductively: the sarcasm happened because of literal mind-control to convey the sarcastic points of view literally. I turned those linguistic forces into sarcasm. The part of me that I control invalidated the fascism of the collective consciousness forces that regulate my brain's language centers (Wernicke's and Broca's areas) independent to my mind, spirit, or any non-collective level of my individual consciousness. And yes, we all suffer this, usually unknowingly. The sarcasm wasn't mine, and I made sure my truth was consistent through the language processes. Also, note: I know nothing about my dad. That part was also porkbarrel. I don't understand it. (And, **no**, not allegory to anything).

This veers too close into "prophet" territory, but that's not how I perceive myself. The odds of being a shaman are like 1 in 50 by the way. That's closer to how I identify. More specifically, this is how I identify: the combination of Frodo, Sam, and Smeagol (and currently ready to sail into the Gray Havens after more tragedy than can be summarized, often at the hands of institutions designed to help me); or Aang from Avatar the Last Airbender; Harry Potter (at the moment shouting "EXPECTO PATRONUS!" or writing "I must not tell lies"); Steven Universe; Tyrion Lannister (I'm 5'5" and 110lb by the way, and capable of being clever); or maybe Monkey D. Luffy. If my writing doesn't convey the combination of that set of characters, then it is not doing me justice. Real figures I like: Bernie, Krystal Ball, Kyle Kulinski, ShoeOnHead (June Nicole Lapine), Russell Brand, and Sadhguru.

I have done every discipline imaginable to heal my own mind and I know the path forward is relational.

Aside from the implausible possibility of deriving a new physics model that grabs the public's attention, existing resources do not permit me to do anything more to heal myself from the social damage I am victim to, including medical and basic.

[^1]: The linked malpractice damages do not cover the full extent of them. That link is more so about the termination damages, elaborated on more as well [here](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff/blob/main/Stuff42-GradsAlliance-draft.md). Unfortunately, I have not been able to summarize the medical damages that followed the hair loss. Maybe [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Badpill/comments/ccu0az/phd_student_with_bright_future_life_ruined_by/?rdt=37366). Oh wow, "r/BadPill" was banned?? What??? It's a recovery subreddit for people damaged by prescription pharmaceuticals. Literally one of the only complete summaries of my benzodiazepine trauma induced on me was summarized there, and it was the top post there for 3 years. That is really suspicious, okay.
