Here’s what Spiderman no way home got wrong.

It began well, established an interesting, wild premise. 

But it became a love letter to allopathic medicine. “If you just give them the right drugs, even if by coercion, it’ll be better!”

They lost the thread of the story they were telling. They went with the obvious and predictable twist (“the bad guys escape and it turns into a big boss battle!”) instead of where the creative tone of the story was taking itself. The bad guys should’ve been cured as planned (by their own participation and choice) and then the story should’ve become about getting the other spidermens home, with more creative choices along the way.

That would’ve been the easy way to do it. Even deeper, philosophically, would’ve been to take the story much slower and allow the bad guys to change on their own personal narrative arcs, as Spike did in Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Paradot in Steven Universe. Not by some drug (or even chip), but by un-defeatable human traits. Spirit, unconditional love, from within, winning the war that goes on within. 

Thor 5’s ending got it right actually, though it was also rushed. The bad guy gave his life ultimately to complete the arc that started his story: saving his daughter. And “God” or fate, the very things he cursed, in fact answered the prayers that he entrusted them with at the beginning, before she died, before he became, kind-of justifiably, evil. That wasn’t a story about redemption, but about righteous vengeance and its divine-mandated fulfillment, despite the Christian Bale character being a villain. Spiderman no way home took more of a redemption approach with the bad guys, making it expressed as a central philosophy by the protagonist.

The philosophy of redemption is good, but “drug them and it’ll be alright” is the worst possible interpretation of that philosophy.

As soon as the green goblin received the prescribed medicine, he suddenly realized all of the errors of his ways, dis-identifying with all of them. Metaphorically, this isn’t a whole, justified journey. A journey should be an integration, of both worlds within the human heart, e.g. “breaking good”, not a disavowal of everything from before. Evil, in real humanity, never comes from nothing.

Reversing it isn’t directly possible. It must be channeled into the form that suits the human heart creating and suffering it.

The light tone of the movie also didn’t afford all the trauma it put the main spidey character through, and didn’t actually explore or remedy or address or show understanding to the actual trauma of those depicted events.
Neither the hero nor the pseudo-villains were done justice.

It was just a love letter to allopathic medicine. And a well-intentioned but ignorant take on an important philosophy about redemption for those who go wayward: that there is a way home. Not quite delivered by the movie as anything other than a yellow-brick-road of drugs synthesized by implausible geniuses. Hence perhaps “no way home”.
