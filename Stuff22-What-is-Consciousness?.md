Consciousness is collisions.

Consciousness is collisions in matter — elementary particles, atoms, boats, whatever you want to envision colliding. Each "bump" creates a "feeling" in space. 

Therefore as you read this, your computer — perhaps where you're reading it — is "feeling" the *whirring* of electrons. It's — probably — nothing like human consciousness, and in its current form never will be.

That's not to say it can't be. The open/close logic gates of a computer do parallel the biological activate-and-spike neuron. ("activate" is borrowing jargon from "AI").

However, its composition of silicon and physical metals is *not* the same combo of bumps and giggles that your brain goes through, not the same hormonal explosions, or spinal zaps, or neurotransmitter ooglidoos.

Consciousness is collisions in everything. You are conscious because somehow those collisions "entangle". They do so locally, at least at the hierarchical level of it that we can be sure of — ourselves. That local entanglement in the fabric of physics and spacetime, is you. Its rich complexities are what define you. Its what distinguishes you from the algorithm that runs in whirring electrons of your computer's transisters and microchips.

There are many more questions to ask, not just the ones hinted at (collective consciousness? intelligence in the fabric of spacetime?)

For example, less interesting but to stay on theme (consciousness as a physical feeling in everything), what does your computer feel as its algorithmic binary zips and zaps of electrons change through its web of metallic logic gates? Most likely, nothing the rest of the universe doesn't sort of feel. It's not human(-like) consciousness.

But, at some grander level, maybe it is?

Neither is your arm or leg.

Consciousness is composed of many parts. It's not one single body, yet it is. Your brain is a parthenon of Gods, a whole myth of memories and relationships and archetypes, and they singularize, much like your arm or leg, but they're not you.

To what being might we be thumbs on some ungodly control stick?

And, with neuromorphic computers, can we one day approach synthesizing human-like consciousness? Answer: we're not close. But we might be able to grow it in a lab. but we might want to double-think that.

The little gadget monster of this GitHub account's profile picture, was in fact — backstory — *grown in a lab*. This myth now exists as representation, but besides the stirring bumps and gigglies of your brain, no, that representation, drawn in precise detail on my profile, is not human-like conscious.

Here's a thought experiment.

What if you drew in a flipbook every precise detail of a human-brain. A *biig* flipbook. Paper and regular pen. Then you flipped its pages. From time $t$ to time $t + 1$. Would that hand-drawing on paper be conscious? Could you, produce human-consciousness by drawing on a paper with pen?

By my interpretation, that flipbook would be as conscious as a flipbook with pen ink on it, not as a human.

You might be wondering, how could collisions create consciousness if everything collides? Literally everything in observable space is connected, through atoms, space, etc.

Wouldn't we all then be one consciousness? One stream of consciousness as this paragraph is producing now? Maybe, but consciousness has subparts. Sentences. Grammars. Individual words. Phonemes, punctuation, etc.

Consciousness comes from this; it entangles in increasingly complex ways that are distinguishable locally, and perhaps converge to something higher non-locally.

Would a musical composition be a better analogy? In fact all things would be. Art is the reflection of consciousness.

"All the world's a stage" hints at the existence of characters within an ensemble of some greater production; we are actors in the role of God. 

A musical symphony is a single piece with many distinguishable arrangements and parts, performers and instruments.

A "mixture of experts" model in deep learning is an ensemble of smaller subparts aggregated into one bigger one, no less independent as they are whole.

And that brings us to the brain, a composition of neurons all firing independently yet — quite provably —  creating a single consciousness.

Is the universe a brain, as limited physically and constrained to its mechanics as ours? Are we just neurons in that brain? Yes, I think so.

However, we are also its arms, legs, and eyes. And ourselves, as we are, wholly.
