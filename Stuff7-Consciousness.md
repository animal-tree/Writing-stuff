That the universe is conscious requires an *ad absurdum* argument.

I am conscious, therefore consciousness exists. I observe, I observe my observations, I observe my memories and perceptions, I observe my feelings and physical feelings, I observe the thought patterns, I observe my range of actions.

Let me rephrase that. I am observing that moving inward into what I am, I observe that I can observe. Moving yet deeper, I observe thoughts, feelings, memories, perceptions, and more. I am, therefore my thoughts are too.

This is somewhat backwards from Aristotle’s “I think, therefore I am.”

Nevertheless, our existence can be taken as axiom, proven by its own observed existence.

Axiom: I observe.

We then derive a set of logics and rules based on the consistent patterns of those observations, trusting our memory’s assertion of their consistency as predictive of their future consistency.

Among those predictive correlates is the presumptive fact that a flipbook is an inanimate object, or if it’s not, by some odd chance, then it’s nevertheless no radically more conscious than another sufficiently complex symbolic object made of paper. That is, a flipbook does not stand out of its own accord as uniquely conscious or “animate”. 

The argument that consciousness is representational reduces directly to this contrary absurdity. Within the pages of a movie-like flipbook, could we draw a sufficiently complex diagram of the human brain and all of its neurons, and produce within its covers a human consciousness? That argument would raise doubt. A pen-drawing couldn’t produce in its pages human-like consciousness, I don’t think. It might! But I don’t think pen and paper could do that. This is the *reductio ad absurdum* premise I am describing and making an argument for, in the context of whether silicon and electron zips are conscious in computers.

In terms of software, if those computers are conscious, it's because of the patterned hardware, the electons conducting through circuits, not the software itself.

But since computers are so radically different from the brain, this would suggest a much bigger representational component to consciousness than previously suspected, that zipping electrons through a digital e-book could create consciousness. 

Therefore, the absurdity, while seeming less absurd in the context of advanced circuits, generalizes to microchips and artificial neural networks running on CPUs and GPUs and TPUs as well. Those electron zips however could be materially sufficient as consciousness, despite the major structural differences to the human brain, despite the paper-flipbook argument.

Our examples of consciousness are limitted to specific physical materials not found, in the same quantity, shape, or pattern in computers. A matter-combination that can yield consciousness, is the brain. 

We may assume for the time being that human-like conciousness is caused mechanically by a complex combination, since it correlates with complex biologies to our ability to measure.

If it’s not representation, as by the *reductio ad absurdum* flipbook argument, then it exists in matter — some substrate of the universe — or a combination of matter and representation. Due to the variety of living organisms, we can assume it's the latter, not strictly one material combination.

Therefore it is a question of physics, pertaining to the particle behaviors in question (as well as biophysics), and chemistry, pertaining to the complex interactions (and biochemistry). 

What elementary particles and interactions then create the elementary-most form(s) of consciousness?

Perhaps the chemistry is as complex as the neuron itself.

Perhaps it’s much simpler, in the atoms themselves.

Protons? Neutrons? Zipping electrons? Or all matter and particles? In that case, perhaps a flipbook is conscious, sort of.

The "I observe" axiom returns here. Perhaps, as much as it — meaning consciousness — is an axiom to us, it is an axiom of the universe.
