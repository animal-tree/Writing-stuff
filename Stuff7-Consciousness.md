That the universe is conscious requires an *ad absurdum* argument.

I am conscious, therefore consciousness exists. I observe, I observe my observations, I observe my memories and perceptions, I observe my feelings and physical feelings, I observe the thought patterns, I observe my range of actions.

Let me rephrase that. I am observing that moving inward into what I am, I observe that I can observe. Moving yet deeper, I observe thoughts, feelings, memories, perceptions, and more. I am, therefore my thoughts are too.

This is somewhat backwards from Aristotle’s “I think, therefore I am.”

Nevertheless, our existence can be taken as axiom, proven by its own observed existence.

Axiom: I observe.

We then derive a set of logics and rules based on the consistent patterns of those observations, trusting our memory’s assertion of their consistency as predictive of their future consistency.

Among those predictive correlates is the presumptive fact that a flipbook is an inanimate object, or if it’s not, by some odd chance, then it’s nevertheless no radically more conscious than another sufficiently complex symbolic object made of paper. That is, a flipbook does not stand out of its own accord as uniquely conscious or “animate”. 

A pen-drawing couldn’t produce in its pages human-like consciousness, I don’t think. It might! But I don’t think pen and paper could do that, even if in the contexts of that flipbook we could draw the brain perfect detail over time.

No more so silicon and electron zips.

Therefore, the absurdity, while seeming less absurd in the context of advanced circuits, generalizes to microchips and artificial neural networks running on CPUs and GPUs and TPUs as well. Those electron zips however could be the defining factor however, not the representation, so the physical material property of the object simulating the symbolic brain function would make more sense as a causal explanation for consciousness than representation alone.

In that matter, the brain, in conjunction with the body and nervous system, being conscious, is exemplar proof — as far as the limits of observation can take us — of a matter-combination that can yield consciousness.

We may assume for the time being that human-like conciousness is a complex combination.

If it’s not representation, as by the *reductio ad absurdum* flipbook argument, then it’s matter — some substrate of the universe — or a combination of matter and representation. Due to the variety of living organisms, we can assume it's the latter.

But what is the elementary-most form of consciousness? 

Perhaps the chemistry is as complex as the neuron itself.

Perhaps it’s much simpler, in the atoms themselves.

Protons? Neutrons? Zipping electrons? Or all matter and particles? In that case, perhaps a flipbook is conscious, sort of.

The "I observe" axiom returns here. Perhaps, as much as it — meaning consciousness — is an axiom to us, it is an axiom of the universe.
