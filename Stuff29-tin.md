How did we get to the age of burning such hot metals?

It began with bronze.

A strong, warm-golden metal, perfect for weaponry and cookware.

But to get bronze we had to scrape tin and copper and burn them to melting. Luckily, both burn relatively easy. They were smelted in a sand mould and produced stronger material than iron! And melt easier. 

But tin is scarce. 

Iron was a regression, a weaker metal that became competitive in trade due to the volcanic eruptions and earthquakes and trade disruptions in 1200 - 1150 B.C.. This was the collapse of the Bronze Age. As an element, “iron” is rarely iron, rather, composed of oxidized iron and carbon and more. While this iron is abundant, the smelting of copper and the rarer tin actually produced a much better alloy: bronze, so it wasn't considered worth substituting it. But it was thanks to those Bronze Age disruptions that the bronze trade collapsed and gave way to this iron, though weaker, which by chance gave way to pig iron, a purer de-carbonized iron, and then steel, the actual iron, as far as iron gets without combusting due to oxidization: minimal carbon iron, steel, an alloy much stronger than both iron and bronze and all of the previous metals, discovered due to the chance regression at the close of the Bronze Age and after a stagnation in the dawn of the Iron Age. 

From sand moulds to pig iron to steel, our fires eventually got hotter and hotter. Using one metal to burn the next. We, like electrons, proliferated our own ignition commotion.

Thus, by odd fortune, in the guise of misfortune, we've arrived to the steel age, the robot age, and...

well, there's another use for fire. Electricity. Electromagnetism. Communication through light waves such as the ones broadcasting to your cellphone and internet right now.

How does that alchemy happen? Motors and oscillators, more or less. Motors powered, usually, by fire (of the hydrocarbons in coal or fossil fuel / oil) and oscillators powered by the electrical currents converted from that motor's spinning magnetic voltage-conduction.
