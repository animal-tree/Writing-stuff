### Proof overview

Suppose causality. $C_1$

Then treating Prob(causality) = 1 as a random variable in causality, requiring a cause,

We have that some number of steps $n$ derives causality. And the recurrence repeats.

lim etc.

Now do away with supposing causality. Suppose 

1. Qualia. $Q$
2. lim etc. $C_2$

We show that together, since $C_1 \rightarrow C_2$ and $C_2, Q \rightarrow C_1$, then, under Qualia, $Q \rightarrow C_1, C_2$

Furthermore $C_2, Q \rightarrow$ implies our universe Omega $\Omega$.

And Omega implies $Q$.

Qualia somehow seems analogous to gravity / dark matter in its definition.

---

Well, under Qualia, if we have $C_1 \rightarrow C_2$ and $C_2, Q \rightarrow C_1$,

Then assuming $Q$ gives us

$C_1 \rightarrow C_2$ and $C_2 \rightarrow C_1$

gives us

$C_1 = C_2$.

Then, since we have supposed $C_2$, we have $C_1$.

Thus, we've proven $C_1$, $C_2$ under the existence of Qualia.

---

Qualia is whatever:

1. In tandem with $C_2$, implies $C_1$
2. In tandem with $C_1$ or $C_2$, implies our universe $\Omega$
3. Is implied by "I observe", taking $o$ as irrefutable

If these rules are satisfied, then we've proven $\Omega$, $Q$, $C_1$, and $C_2$ without requiring axiom.

Since no axiom is made, the existence of all 4 becomes incontrovertible. We have proven them definitively, as an origin of existence that is true on the premise of nothing. We have also shown,already, how something could arise from nothing.

**Epistemology**

Existence $o$ meanwhile, is proven by "I observe, therefore I am."

However, that does not prove $\Omega$.

That implication, as any about observable reality beyond the present and moment, is probabilistic and assumes that we can trust our memories. Since we do (generally), by definition, we can.

That includes our memories from which we derive evidence of $Q$.

That does not mean our memories our true.

---

**Philosophy**

The only axiom that is made, philosophically speaking, is "definition".

More generally, everything that implies our observations, without axiom, except the probabalistic evidence that our observations imply the implication, is proven.

More concretely:

1. Any implication that requires no axiom is proven. This is defined as definition.
2. Our observations can be trusted.
3. If a set of definitions is implied by our observations, then it is proven.

A.K.A. science.

I think what we've shown is that if Omega is assumed, it exists. If it's not assumed, it still exists. Which is a step further showing how something arises from nothing. However, that implication would depend on a new axiom: Qualia. If that axiom somehow is equivalent to "I observe" and no further deductions (A.K.A. epistemologies based on trusting memory), then it is proven, since "I observe" is irrefutable and there is no "Suppose I don't", (even if we suppose nothing else about Omega).

That's the insight of this proof.

Maybe something else too.

In other words, assuming Omega says "assume I can trust my memories." All observable reality beliefs reduce to observation and memory. However, memory isn't proven. It's believed. Observation is proven.

We can say assume Omega, or equivalently, assume our memories.

Otherwise, don't assume Omega, only assume observation. $t =$ now

Since observation ("I observe") is fact, any deduction, if deduction can be trusted, is fact. But by definition, (fact or not, technically, bizarreness aside), it's proven.

That is: something can be proven without being true. If it is deduced, it is proven. By definition of proof. But deduction may not necessarily itself be proven. What's especially interesting about this above argument, is that it also aims to prove causality, which can then perhaps prove deduction, making the proof complete, and the first one to be proven true, within this cyclical self-framework, except for Ren√© Descartes' "I doubt, therefore I am."

Deduction only depends on the axiom of definition. So, technically, it's impossible to prove. That step might be an overreach. 

Otherwise, reduction to "I observe" is an irrefutable proof. If it can cyclically encompass causality, qualia, and observed reality (including memory), then it's a proof of, well, perhaps itself. Perhaps a definition of its very self.

Every other proof of physical reality, or theory of it, depends on "I observe" and the truth of memory as axioms. Memory is believed, but not yet proven. So this proof is far larger in scope.

Do you understand? We are proving memory can be trusted.

Dialectical partner: "Er, cyclically. But yes."

Not cyclically. By definition.

[This makes me cry because memory includes all the feelings of the past that have been disproven by the people who betrayed them.]

---

In summary, everything that happens in physical reality is just the dictionary definition of observation. Not my or your observation exactly, but observation itself. Observation is definition, an Identity function with infinite Qualia. Those different characterizations existing, is as true as deduction. Somehow, together with causality or its direct mathematical consequence, they imply our physical reality. Meanwhile, in tandem with Qualia, causality and its direct mathematical consequence imply each other.
