### Proof overview

Suppose causality. $C_1$

Then treating Prob(causality) = 1 as a random variable in causality, requiring a cause,

We have that some number of steps $n$ derives causality. And the recurrence repeats.

lim etc.

Now do away with supposing causality. Suppose 

1. Qualia. $Q$
2. lim etc. $C_2$

We show that together, since $C_1 \rightarrow C_2$ and $C_2, Q \rightarrow C_1$, then, under Qualia, $Q \rightarrow C_1, C_2$

Furthermore $C_2, Q \rightarrow$ implies our universe Omega $\Omega$.

And Omega implies $Q$.

Qualia somehow seems analogous to gravity / dark matter in its definition.

---

Well, under Qualia, if we have $C_1 \rightarrow C_2$ and $C_2, Q \rightarrow C_1$,

Then assuming $Q$ gives us

$C_1 \rightarrow C_2$ and $C_2 \rightarrow C_1$

gives us

$C_1 = C_2$.

Then, since we have supposed $C_2$, we have $C_1$.

Thus, we've proven $C_1$, $C_2$ under the existence of Qualia.

---

Qualia is whatever:

1. In tandem with $C_2$, implies $C_1$
2. In tandem with $C_1$ or $C_2$, implies our universe $\Omega$
3. Is implied by "I observe", taking $o$ as irrefutable

If these rules are satisfied, then we've proven $\Omega$, $Q$, $C_1$, and $C_2$ without requiring axiom.

Since no axiom is made, the existence of all 4 becomes incontrovertible. We have proven them definitively, as an origin of existence that is true on the premise of nothing. We have also shown,already, how something could arise from nothing.

---

**Epistemology**

Existence $o$ meanwhile, is proven by "I observe, therefore I am."

However, that does not prove $\Omega$.

That implication, as any about observable reality beyond the present and moment, is probabilistic and assumes that we can trust our memories. Since we do (generally), by definition, we can.

That includes our memories from which we derive evidence of $Q$.

That does not mean our memories our true.

---

**Philosophy**

The only axiom that is made, philosophically speaking, is "definition".

More generally, everything that implies our observations, without axiom, except the probabalistic evidence that our observations imply the implication, is proven.

More concretely:

1. Any implication that requires no axiom is proven. This is defined as definition.
2. Our observations can be trusted.
3. If a set of definitions is implied by our observations, then it is proven.

A.K.A. science.

I think what we've shown is that if Omega is assumed, it exists. If it's not assumed, it still exists. Which is a step further showing how something arises from nothing. However, that implication would depend on a new axiom: Qualia. If that axiom somehow is equivalent to "I observe" and no further deductions (A.K.A. epistemologies based on trusting memory), then it is proven, since "I observe" is irrefutable and there is no "Suppose I don't", (even if we suppose nothing else about Omega).

That's the insight of this proof.

Maybe something else too.

In other words, assuming Omega says "assume I can trust my memories." All observable reality beliefs reduce to observation and memory. However, memory isn't proven. It's believed. Observation is proven.

We can say assume Omega, or equivalently, assume our memories.

Otherwise, don't assume Omega, only assume observation. $t =$ now

Since observation ("I observe") is fact, any deduction, if deduction can be trusted, is fact. But by definition, (fact or not, technically, bizarreness aside), it's proven.

That is: something can be proven without being true. If it is deduced, it is proven. By definition of proof. But deduction may not necessarily itself be proven. What's especially interesting about this above argument, is that it also aims to prove causality, which can then perhaps prove deduction, making the proof complete, and the first one to be proven true, within this cyclical self-framework, except for RenÃ© Descartes' "I doubt, therefore I am."

Deduction only depends on the axiom of definition. So, technically, it's impossible to prove. That step might be an overreach. 

Otherwise, reduction to "I observe" is an irrefutable proof. If it can cyclically encompass causality, qualia, and observed reality (including memory), then it's a proof of, well, perhaps itself. Perhaps a definition of its very self.

Every other proof of physical reality, or theory of it, depends on "I observe" and the truth of memory as axioms. Memory is believed, but not yet proven. So this proof is far larger in scope.

Do you understand? We are proving memory can be trusted.

Dialectical partner: "Er, cyclically. But yes."

Not cyclically. By definition.

[This makes me cry because memory includes all the feelings of the past that have been disproven by the people who betrayed them.]

---

In summary, everything that happens in physical reality is just the dictionary definition of observation. Not my or your observation exactly, but observation itself. Observation is definition, an Identity function with infinite Qualia. Those different characterizations existing, is as true as deduction. Just define them as functionally equivalent but with different variable names, by the axiom of definition. Somehow, together with causality or its direct mathematical consequence, cyclicality, they "existing", per Qualia, imply our physical reality. Meanwhile, in tandem with Qualia, causality and its direct mathematical consequence, cyclicality, imply each other, completing the cycle to define all of reality back to the meaning of "I observe". Proving it, without axiom, unless definition counts.

Meanwhile, proving our physical reality, for the first time ever, proves that our memories are (generally) true.

We can then add an axiom to "I observe." "I remember."

This proves many things, including the validity of belief. Belief is the axiom underpinning all science. Belief in others, belief in institutions, belief in evidence not directly seen by one's present eyes. Faith.

Whatever this function is define it as $\mathrm{I}$. Let's give it infinite equivalents, again by definition:

$\mathrm{I}_1 = \mathrm{I}_2 = \cdots$.

Each of these exists by definition.

Now apply these observers to each other. $\mathrm{I}_i(\mathrm{I}_j) = \mathrm{I}_j, \mathrm{I}_j(\mathrm{I}_i) = \mathrm{I}_i$.

We now have infinite variety.

Define this as Qualia.

We will not assume $\mathrm{I}_i(\mathrm{I}_j) = \mathrm{I}_k$. The identies are distinguishable. This would contradict the definition, but we can include a self-reference in the function without loss of generality:

$\mathrm{I}_i(\mathrm{I}_j, j) \neq \mathrm{I}_i(\mathrm{I}_k, k) \vert i \neq k$

The subscripts can be interpretted in any number of ways. We define them as qualia, lowercase and propose their existence. 

Short form:

>
> $\mathrm{I}_1 = \mathrm{I}_2 = \cdots$.

> Each of these exists by definition.

Define the subscripts of Qualia as qualia and denote them $\mathbb{N}$.

We will now premise on two possibilities: (1) the existence of causality and (2) no assumption about the existence of causality.

The existence of causality:

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y, \mathrm{R}) = 1$

$x$ is the cause, $y$ is the effect, under some dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$.

For every effect $y$, there is a cause $x$.

Defining observation as $o$, we have

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y=o, \mathrm{R}) = 1$

for some sample of $x, \mathrm{R}$,

where  $o = \mathrm{I}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$,

and physics model $\mathrm{R}$, just defining.

---

Scratch that

The existence of causality:

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y) > 0$

$x$ is the cause, $y$ is the effect, under some dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$.

For every effect $y$, there is a cause $x$.

Then $\exists \hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ s.t.

$\mathbf{P}((o, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{\hat{R}}^n(x, h^{(0)})) > 0$

where $o = \mathrm{I}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is observation and $\hat{\mathrm{R}} \sim \mathrm{R}$ is a physics model.

What this says is that every effect has a cause. And if that is the case then there is a causal *system*, $\hat{R}$ that can describe it. Causality is akin to axiomatic deduction. However, we make no assumptions about the rules, or any axioms, or even the determinism of the aforementioned rules. They could very well change from moment by moment as denoted by the capacity of $h$, a "memory".

We can also ask

$\mathbf{P}((\mathbb{N}, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{\hat{R}}^n(x, h^{(0)})) > 0$

what is the cause of qualia, the Natural numbers? Should we now denote qualia as $\mathbb{N} \subset o = \mathrm{I}_\mathbb{N}$? Set theory doesn't have an answer to this.

Probability theory might.

Define $\mathbb{N}$ as a random variable. There is an infinite countable set of natural numbers. However that infinity can be sampled from arbitrarily in the infinitum in each use case. A number can be true when it's used and false otherwise. It is a construct. A belief. This brings us to belief:

$\mathbf{P}(B \vert E) = \frac{\mathbf{P}(E \vert B)\mathbf{P}(B)}{\mathbf{P}(E)}$

A number is a belief, by the human. Our evidence for it is the representational utility to describing consistencies in our world.

While such a belief might not be a "subset" of $o$, it can be represented by $o$. Take for example the binary number 1: it can be represented $\mathrm{I_1}(\mathrm{I_2})(\cdot)$. The binary 0 can be represented $\mathrm{I_1}((\mathrm{I_2})\cdot)$, for any given input.
