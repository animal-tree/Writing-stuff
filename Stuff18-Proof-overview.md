**The actual derivation would be sampling particles from Gaussians and optimizing their branching-probability wave-duality paths, from each local collision as a convolved function, to each non-local trajectory as a probabilistic variational optimization like beam search, but I'm sick and tired of thinking about this.**

I also have a classical description for gravity theorized.[^1]

...

Dark matter bouncing between two objects creates a pressure gradient in surrounding dark matter. A “bend” in spacetime, literalized. Dark matter interacts with mass to change its velocity only under some conditions. One of those is the pressure gradient created by that back and forth bounce. You can imagine it as a smiley face bouncing back and forth between two unhappy bodies. This only happens in the presence of other masses. It’s a 3-way interaction. At least. One dark matter. Mass A. And Mass B.

Mysteries

- Gravity / dark matter: self-creation / bouncing-happy-smiley-faces
- Relativity: Yes, from a belief perspective [with photon as choice of carrier signal for inter-body communication](Stuff10-Observation.md)
- Wave-particle duality: optimization
- Rules: [limited resources of Qualia/observation constrained to time](All-science-reduces-to-the-sensory.md)

Also subparts making up people that I call archetypes, literally consciousnesses within consciousnesses. Communicating. Through local symbolic languages, sometimes cryptic. A superconsciousness, collective “governance”, not necessarily a good one, and so on.

If there isn’t a God, there most certainly can be, from what I’ve seen. Via collective [consciousness](Stuff11-Consciousness.md) intelligence and potentially actual control to some variational degree of physical matter, the modulation of which could be a communication mechanism with people, assuming we’ve evolved a symbiosis for it.

And that’s a lot of what I know! In vague condensed form, reduced from stacks of composition notebooks and journals. With math.
