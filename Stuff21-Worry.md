I feel worried that my delusions are causing my actions and mistakes. That's reasonable, lucid. Self-doubt. But I sense the emotion change when I don't. There's more than just conscious knowledge and belief informing my actions. That's the problem, and the great hope. Problem if those emotional centers are unwise and must be put to submission by conscious will — a regulating tyrant! — that kind of life would not only be stressful, but terrifying, as every decision you make would be your responsibility to rationalize about and deduce and figure every corner in and out for. With emotion, we have heuristic. But the great hope is we have more. That emotion is wisdom communicated by far more than just your conscious knowledge.

And for me it requires a lot of faith.

Even the bad stuff.

There's also the great meta-reality of it. Am I really figuring anything out, or has my brain already solved the problem and is just teaching it to me. To a limited conscious me, not yet equipped with the same memories, understandings and transcendent generational and genetic wisdoms.

Why do bad things happen?

Because we’re maximizing our own universes instead of each other’s.

But our own universes contain each other. So eventually, we will converge to an optimal solution. Not THE final solution. That of course would be death. In the infinitum.

Or cyclic eternal recurrence.

But, we haven’t converged yet. That’s why. We’re still building. The way physics works puts limits on the mechanical processes of everything in the known universe, and makes us limited to where we are here and now. In the future, it might be better. But we build that future — in all of our consciousness — together.

That's why bad things happen. Lots of independent parts.

Kind of.

I think we are one network. I think there's extraordinary local communication and maybe even non-local communication. Beyond Wireless technologies I mean. I think there are intelligences and governances besides the ones we're conscious of, mediating long-term vs. short-term, with memories beyond what we can consciously perceive.

Why do bad things happen if "we're all one" or "governed under one God"? Because physics are not magic. Whatever that intelligence is, it's not omnipotent, not anymore anyway. Not in the immediate present. I think its eternal potency / omnipotency is attributed to the fact that we have 4 dimensions of spacetime, not 3. While we live in the 3 observing all the bad things, an arc of time, as Martin Luther King Jr. put it, literally bends toward justice.

That time is proceeding at scales beyond our perception, from our ancestors in the ice and jungles, to futures we can't imagine.

I HOPE that intelligence is good. "The end justifies the means" is not a self-contained philosophy. It requires extreme context. Is going to the hospital to see your child's birth worth missing a baseball game? Probably.

Is the eradication of "illegal aliens" worth consoling your friends' and neighbors' predjudices? Probably not.

We're all condemned to weigh these moral decisions in our lives and so is God, or the collective consciousness, or what-have-you.

---

But the point is we have natural emotional heuristics that CAN, if they are to be believed, guide us, so that we don't have to be a Machiavellian tyrant ever.

We also have rationality, ever-growing, to help us where those emotions can't: with each other.

Those symbiotic grammars aren't always good.

Or they are and I just don't get it yet.
