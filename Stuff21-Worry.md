I feel worried that my delusions are causing my actions and mistakes. That's reasonable, lucid. Self-doubt. But I sense the emotion change when I don't. There's more than just conscious knowledge and belief informing my actions. That's the problem, and the great hope. Problem if those emotional centers are unwise and must be put to submission by conscious will — a regulating tyrant! — that kind of life would not only be stressful, but terrifying, as every decision you make would be your responsibility to rationalize about and deduce and figure every corner in and out for. With emotion, we have heuristic. But the great hope is we have more. That emotion is wisdom communicated by far more than just your conscious knowledge.

And for me it requires a lot of faith.

Even the bad stuff.

There's also the great meta-reality of it. Am I really figuring anything out, or has my brain already solved the problem and is just teaching it to me. To a limited conscious me, not yet equipped with the same memories, understandings and transcendent generational and genetic wisdoms.

Why do bad things happen?

Because we’re maximizing our own universes instead of each other’s.

But our own universes contain each other. So eventually, we will converge to an optimal solution. Not THE final solution. That of course would be death. In the infinitum.

Or cyclic eternal recurrence.

But, we haven’t converged yet. That’s why. We’re still building. The way physics works puts limits on the mechanical processes of everything in the known universe, and makes us limited to where we are here and now. In the future, it might be better. But we build that future — in all of our consciousness — together.
