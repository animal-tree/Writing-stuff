I feel worried that my delusions are causing my actions and mistakes. That's reasonable, lucid. Self-doubt. But I sense the emotion change when I don't. There's more than just conscious knowledge and belief informing my actions. That's the problem, and the great hope. Problem if those emotional centers are unwise and must be put to submission by conscious will — a regulating tyrant! — that kind of life would not only be stressful, but terrifying, as every decision you make would be your responsibility to rationalize about and deduce and figure every corner in and out for. With emotion, we have heuristic. But the great hope is we have more. That emotion is wisdom communicated by far more than just your conscious knowledge.

And for me it requires a lot of faith.

Even the bad stuff.

There's also the great meta-reality of it. Am I really figuring anything out, or has my brain already solved the problem and is just teaching it to me. To a limited conscious me, not yet equipped with the same memories, understandings and transcendent generational and genetic wisdoms.
