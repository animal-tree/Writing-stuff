Consciousness is the singularization of the many into one. First, let's consider why it can't be anything else. The alternative possibility is that consciousness is the many (neurons and all that compose the brain), not singularized into one, interacting as independent bodies within a circuit-type system that produces the observed behaviors of conscious beings. From an external perspective, like with the "consciousness zombie" thought experiment, that definition would be indistinguishable from the first. But egocentrically, we can recognize that our experience exists beyond just our observable outward behaviors, but has internal components that we observe with a single spectrum observation. Meanwhile, the neurons producing those experiences are separated in space, the chemical messengers that communicate between them themselves have fermaments separating their physical matter from that of any other physical matter, for the most part. Some particles in physics, called bosons, are able to occupy the same space as other such particles, but other particles, fermions, obey the Pauli exclusion principle, a natural fermament that separates the collapsed values of their quantum states.

So even when we look at a single blazing "lifeforce" in nature — let's say a fire metaphorically — we see it as a single fire, a living creature of one nature and quality. But that fire is composed of oxidized hydrogens and carbons spurting out electrons and photons, all divisible and all locally excluding one another. If the particles were human beings, they'd collide, communicate, and interact in numerous infinite ways but ultimately each one would only know one's own experience and the others only their own, and somehow a fermanent separates the consciousness of the one from the others, and my brain does not singularize with your brain, and your brain does not singularize with my brain, to my knowledge or yours. But our neurons somehow do, with messengers that unify not just information communication, but experience.

Information communication is the alternative possibility to "singularization." The argument might go that your brain communicates the experience information through patterns and encodings, and the illusion of singularized experiences emerges from that. To show that the brain must singularize, it most likely suffices to disprove this alternative possibility, and it is possible to do that through a *reductio ad absurdum* argument: reduction to absurdity, as follows:

Suppose I were to draw every neuron and chemical messenger in your brain at time point $t$ on the first page of a flipbook with pen. And then I drew every neuron and chemical messenger in your brain at time point $t + 1$ on the second page of a flipbook with pen. And so; say I proceeded to do this for up to $N$ time steps in arbitrarily precise detail. Heck, the flipbook can be the size of the moon if it helps the believability of such precision of detail being drawable on its pages with pen ink. But suffice it to say, a flipbook movie is then generated of all of your brain's neural processes, and then I flip those pen-ink stained paper pages. If information communication is all that your human-like consciousness reduces to, then this book composed of mere parchment and ink, is human-like conscious. In fact, it's you-like conscious, experiencing your love, joy, grief, observations, and memories. All by the power of one's pen. If I shrunk it down to teh size of a Bible, would you believe me that the book I hand you is not only alive, but when you flip its pages, it experiences everything you did 10 minutes ago? In all likelihood, you would ifnd that claim dubious.

And likewise, we can extend the analogy to computer circuits, communicating information not on paper but on silicon chips, and not by pen ink but by electrons zipping through open-close logic gates. If the flipbook isn't human-like conscious, then how can this labyrinth of zipping electrons be? Even if those electrons zip through a moon-sized server of GPUs running the most advanced neural network or human brain simulation, their information communication is effectively just the flipping of the paper pages of a flipbook, and once again we obtain absurdity.

So the question is, at what point does this information communication become a physical process that produces consciousness?
