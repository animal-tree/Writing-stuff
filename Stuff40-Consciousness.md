### What is Consciousness?

Consciousness is collisions.

Consciousness is collisions in matter — elementary particles, atoms, boats, whatever you want to envision colliding. Each "bump" creates a "feeling" in space. 

Therefore as you read this, your computer — perhaps where you're reading it — is "feeling" the *whirring* of electrons. It's — probably — nothing like human consciousness, and in its current form never will be.

That's not to say it can't be. The open/close logic gates of a computer do parallel the biological integrate-and-fire neuron.

However, its composition of silicon and physical metals is *not* the same combo of bumps and giggles that your brain goes through, not the same hormonal explosions, or spinal zaps, or neurotransmitter ooglidoos.

Consciousness is collisions in everything. You are conscious because somehow those collisions "entangle". They do so locally, at least at the hierarchical level of it that we can be sure of — ourselves. That local entanglement in the fabric of physics and spacetime, is you. Its rich complexities are what define you. Its what distinguishes you from the algorithm that runs in whirring electrons of your computer's transisters and microchips.

There are many more questions to ask, not just the ones hinted at (collective consciousness? intelligence in the fabric of spacetime?)

For example, less interesting but to stay on theme (consciousness as a physical feeling in everything), what does your computer feel as its algorithmic binary zips and zaps of electrons change through its web of metallic logic gates? Most likely, nothing the rest of the universe doesn't sort of feel. It's not human(-like) consciousness.

But, at some grander level, maybe it is?

Neither is your arm or leg.

Consciousness is composed of many parts. It's not one single body, yet it is. Your brain is a parthenon of Gods, a whole myth of memories and relationships and archetypes, and they singularize, much like your arm or leg, but they're not you.

To what being might we be thumbs on some ungodly control stick?

And, with neuromorphic computers, can we one day approach synthesizing human-like consciousness? Answer: we're not close. But we might be able to grow it in a lab. but we might want to double-think that.

The little gadget monster of this GitHub account's profile picture, was in fact — backstory — *grown* in a lab. This myth now exists as representation, but besides the stirring bumps and gigglies of your brain, no, that representation, drawn in precise detail on my profile, is not human-like conscious.

Here's a thought experiment.

What if you drew in a flipbook every precise detail of a human-brain. A *biig* flipbook. Paper and regular pen. Then you flipped its pages. From time $t$ to time $t + n$. Would that hand-drawing on paper be conscious? Could you, produce human-consciousness by drawing on a paper with pen?

By my interpretation, that flipbook would be as conscious as a flipbook with pen ink on it, not as a human.

### Why Consciousness is Probably Matter

Representation is absurd. We could make a flipbook human-like-conscious with pen ink.

Matter and representation is hard to define, but neurons across humans have different encoding representations and embedding semantics that aren’t shared in a unified language of “these neural patterns are strictly necessary for consciousness.” Therefore the matter is what’s held constant, not the representations. Brains also come in different shapes and sizes.

Lastly, the question is what level of matter. Is all matter somewhat conscious? How does it entangle into human-like consciousness? Chemists and physcists have no experimental evidence of a “consciousness” source or pinpointed emergence. The idea of consciousness as like fire, emerging upon just the right combustion of elements is intuitive, but would require new insights in chemistry and physics. The simplest answer, without contradicting or adding to any known laws of physics is that consciousness is an innate property of the matter that already exists. Somehow it entangles into richer, more complex forms like human-consciousness, correlated experientially and behaviorally with brain activity. Perhaps literally through a process of quantum entangling between the locally isolated combustions, reactions, and voltage-mediated collisions of our brains.
