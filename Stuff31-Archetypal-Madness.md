I am Chenliang, Sam's advisor. He writes this with telepathic interference from Josh, Sam's friend. Together, and this is Sam speaking, we shall derive the universe. Not derivatively of course. That would require ample physical sciences background. But sufficiently well-reasonedly, with made-up words here and there. Let's begin with a less exhausting setup. "I observe." It is true, therefore it is. At any rate, fading into sleep-deprivative exhaustion as I may be, I am reluctant tosay this won't work. Largely because of the intensive time and money — "minimum wage" Josh chimes in — investment that has gone into this project. Well, so be it. The whole of the universe, in one shebang. It starts with time. But time exists as a physical construct not a mathematically deduced one. So let us find an incredibly stupid place to hide it. In equivalence.

Alright. Given $A = B$, we know $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow A$. We don't know *when* $A \rightarrow B$. Is it in $1$ deductive step $A \rightarrow_1 B$? Is it in $n$ deductive steps $A \rightarrow_n B$. From this, we get a cheap hacky way to derive something out of literally nothing.

Let us start with nothing $\emptyset$.

Don't regard it as the empty set. Don't regard it at all.

$\emptyset_0 = \emptyset_1 = \cdots$

are all nothing, with just subscripts added.

There we now have causality, constrained only to a cyclical loop between every nothing and every other nothing. e.g.

$\emptyset_0 \rightarrow \emptyset_1 \rightarrow \cdots$

$\emptyset_0 \leftarrow \emptyset_1 \leftarrow \cdots$

These nodes can connect in any number of ways and create a multi-branched graph. The ambiguities are not necessary. Let us define one such branch/construct that we can say is "Turing equivalent" and be done with it.

Cosmogenesis:

A "grammar" — or word (if we want to make Biblical allusions/puns) — that is Turing equivalent, from nothing.

Go:

How about a tape of $\emptyset_{0,i}$ and $\emptyset_{1,i}$ (zeros and ones, or yins and yangs if you want), where $i$ let's us hackily denote the position on the tape, with implications from each non-sensical bit at deductive step $n$ to each non-sensical bit at deductive step $n + 1$.

The "halt" can be cosmo-genocide, which we are not interested in solving. $\square$
